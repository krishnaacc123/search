[{"title":"Account Validation","desc":"Overview of Account Validation,including APIs and webhook payload, and learn how to validate a customer's bank account.","index":false,"body":"\nAccount validation is the process of validating beneficiary bank account details by transferring a nominal amount to the beneficiary.\nAccount validation can be used to validate:\nBank Account Number: If the amount is successfully transferred to the bank account, we can validate the account number.\n\nBeneficiary Validation: Once the transaction is successful, banks pass on the name linked to the account in the API response. By comparing the name sent by the bank to the name provided by the customer, businesses can successfully validate if the account belongs to the same customer.\n\nAmount Validation: In case you want to perform an amount validation, transfer a random amount ranging between ₹1 and ₹2, for example ₹1.27, and ask them to enter the amount received on the your website. This acts as an additional check to validate that the customer has access to the account.\n\nLife Cycle\n\nAn account validation transaction can have one of the following status:\ncreated - The status assigned to a transaction after Razorpay receives the API request.\ncompleted - This status indicates that the transaction is completed. The results of the account validation transaction are available in the results section of the API response.\n\nCreate an Account Validation Transaction\n\nAccount validation transactions can only be created via APIs.\n\nThe below API endpoint creates an account validation transaction.\n\n/fund_accounts/validations\n\nAn example request and response to create a fund account validation transaction is given below.\n\ncurl -u : \\\n-X POST https://api.razorpay.com/v1/fund_accounts/validations \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-d '{\n\t\"fund_account\":{\n        \"accounttype\": \"bankaccount\",\n        \"bank_account\":{\n            \"name\": \"Gaurav Kumar\",\n            \"ifsc\": \"HDFC0000053\",\n            \"account_number\": \"765432123456789\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"amount\": 100,\n    \"currency\": \"INR\",\n    \"notes\":{\n        \"randomkey1\": \"Make it so.\",\n        \"randomkey2\": \"Tea.

So when you send lineitems array, you would be replacing current set of lineitems with the new set. Given that, you may do something like following: keep some (optionally with updated values) of the existing line items (by lineitem's id\nin dictionary with other optional attributes), remove some of the existing line_items (by not having them in new set at all) and add\nsome new line items by passing new dictionary in same line_items array(or list).\n\nFor example, in Request #1 - lineitems with id ligHQwerty123gg1 will be patched with the updated name and quantity, a new lineitems would be added (the second dictionary in the lineitems array) and all other existing would be removed.\n\nIssue an Invoice\n\nYou can issues an invoice in draft state. A short URL or payment link gets created only when the invoice is in issued state. Only then can the customer proceed with the payment.\n\nThe following endpoint can be used to issue an invoice:\n\n/invoices/:id/issue\n\nIt can only be called on an invoice that is in the draft state. Its response is the invoice entity, similar to create/update API response. Its status now would be issued and it will have short_url generated. Also SMS and Email would be sent to customer based on what parameters were sent initially during creation.\n\ncurl -u rzptest32hsbEKriO6ai4:SC6d7z4FcgX2wJj49obRRT4M \\\n   -X POST \\  https://api.razorpay.com/v1/invoices/inv_gHQwerty123ggd/issue\n\nDelete an Invoice\n\nTo delete an invoice use this endpoint:\n\n/invoices/:id\n\ncurl -u rzptest32hsbEKriO6ai4:SC6d7z4FcgX2wJj49obRRT4M \\\n   -X DELETE \\  https://api.razorpay.com/v1/invoices/inv_gHQwerty123ggd\n\nThe response is always be an empty array, as shown below:\n\n[]\n\nAn invoice in the draft state can be deleted.\n\nCancel an Invoice\n\nTo cancel an unpaid Invoice with given ID via API, use this endpoint:\n\n/invoices/:id/cancel\n\nIt can only be called on an invoice that is not in the paid state. The response for the API will be the invoice entity, similar to create/update API response, with status attribute's value as cancelled.\n\ncurl -u rzptest32hsbEKriO6ai4:SC6d7z4FcgX2wJj49obRRT4M \\\n

This holds good as long as the total transfer amount requested does not exceed the captured payment amount.  - Payments cannot be transferred after a refund is initiated on the paymentid.\n\nNote: All our APIs take amount in Paisa, and not Rupees.\n\nExample Request\n\ncurl /payments/pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA/transfers \\\n   -u {KEY}:{SECRET} \\\n   -d 'transfers0=acc_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7' \\\n   -d 'transfers0=10000' \\\n   -d 'transfers0=INR' \\\n   -d 'transfers1=acc_21t2c3gafu4sa2' \\\n   -d 'transfers1=5000' \\\n   -d 'transfers1=INR'\n\n{\n  \"transfers\": [\n    {\n      \"account\": \"acc_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7\",\n      \"amount\" : 10000,\n      \"currency\": \"INR\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"account\": \"acc_21t2c3gafu4sa2\",\n      \"amount\" : 5000,\n      \"currency\": \"INR\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n{\n  \"entity\": \"collection\",\n  \"count\": 2,\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"trf_6ydVYyzaICeIw5\",\n      \"entity\": \"transfer\",\n      \"source\": \"pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA\",\n      \"recipient\": \"acc_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7\",\n      \"amount\": 10000,\n      \"currency\": \"INR\",\n      \"amount_reversed\": 0,\n      \"on_hold\": false,\n      \"tax\": 16,\n      \"fees\": 4,\n      \"created_at\": 1482996461\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"trf_6ydVZ7a3z4q50q\",\n      \"entity\": \"transfer\",\n      \"source\": \"pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA\",\n      \"recipient\": \"acc_21t2c3gafu4sa2\",\n      \"amount\": 5000,\n      \"currency\": \"INR\",\n      \"amount_reversed\": 0,\n      \"on_hold\": false,\n      \"tax\": 16,\n      \"fees\": 4,\n      \"created_at\": 1482996461\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nFetch Transfers\n\nThis API retrieves the collection of all transfers created on the payment_id.\n\n/payments/:id/transfers\n\nOnce the settlement against the transfer is processed a webhook settlement.processed is sent which contains a recipientsettlementid.\n\nThe details of the settlement can be obtained by appending ?expand[]=recipient_settlement as query parameter to the fetch transfer request which would return a settlement entity along with the transfer entity.\n\nExample Request\n\ncurl /payments/pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA/transfers \\\n   -u {KEY}:{SECRET}\n\nExample Request for Settlement Details\n\ncurl /payments/pay6ydSup2U7aFMsA/transfers?expand[]=recipientsettlement \\\n   -u {KEY}:{SECRET}\n\n{\n  \"entity\": \"collection\",\n  \"count\": 2,\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"trf_6ydVYyzaICeIw5\",\n      \"entity\": \"transfer\",\n      \"source\": \"pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA\",\n      \"recipient\": \"acc_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7\",\n      \"amount\": 10000,\n      \"currency\": \"INR\",\n      \"amount_reversed\": 0,\n      \"on_hold\": false,\n      \"created_at\": 1482996461,\n      \"recipientsettlementid\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"trf_6ydVZ7a3z4q50q\",\n      \"entity\": \"transfer\",\n      \"source\": \"pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA\",\n      \"recipient\": \"acc_21t2c3gafu4sa2\",\n      \"amount\": 5000,\n      \"currency\": \"INR\",\n      \"amount_reversed\": 0,\n      \"on_hold\": false,\n      \"created_at\": 1482996461\n      \"recipientsettlementid\": null\n    }\n  ]\n}\n{\n  \"entity\": \"collection\",\n  \"count\": 4,\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"trf_6ydVYyzaICeIw5\",\n      \"entity\": \"transfer\",\n      \"source\": \"pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA\",\n      \"recipient\": \"acc_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7\",\n      \"amount\": 10000,\n      \"currency\": \"INR\",\n      \"amount_reversed\": 0,\n      \"on_hold\": false,\n      \"created_at\": 1482996461\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"trf_6ydVZ7a3z4q50q\",\n      \"entity\": \"transfer\",\n      \"source\": \"pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA\",\n      \"recipient\": \"acc_21t2c3gafu4sa2\",\n      \"amount\": 5000,\n      \"currency\": \"INR\",\n      \"amount_reversed\": 0,\n      \"on_hold\": false,\n      \"created_at\": 1482996461\n    },\n    {\n    'recipientsettlementid': \"setl_9RO6as5jA8iAFt\",\n    'recipient_settlement': {\n      'id':\"setl_9RO6as5jA8iAFt\",\n      'entity':\"settlement\",\n      'amount': 5000,\n      'status':\"created\",\n      'fees': 0,\n      'tax': 0,\n      'utr': 'KKBKH15401228484',\n      'created_at': 1516348255\n    },\n    {\n    'recipientsettlementid': \"setl_yROtr55jA8ire4\",\n    'recipient_settlement': {\n      'id':\"setl_yROtr55jA8ire4\",\n      'entity':\"settlement\",\n      'amount': 10000,\n      'status':\"created\",\n      'fees': 0,\n      'tax': 0,\n      'utr': 'KKBKH15401228481',\n      'created_at': 1516348255\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nRefund Payments\n\nA payment can be refunded to a customer using Refunds API.\n\nWhen refunding a payment that has transfers, the amount for the refund is deducted\nfrom your main account balance. In order to recover the amount from linked accounts,\nthe reverse_all parameter can be set to 1 in the refund POST request. This will\nrecover the amount from linked accounts for every transfer made on the payment,\nbefore processing the refund to the customer.\n\nNote: The reverse_all attribute is optional. You may also choose to manually\nreverse transfers created on a payment by using the /transfers/:id/reversals which\nis described later on this page.\n\nAutomated Reversals\n\nReversals can be automated with the reverse_all attribute in the following refund\nscenarios:\n\nFull refund\nPartial refund for a payment transferred to a single account.\n\nFor partial refunds on a payment transferred to multiple accounts - the reverse_all\nparameter cannot be applied, since Razorpay cannot determine which transfer to\npartially reverse. You will have to use the transfer reversal API to achieve reversals\non this payment.\n\nExample Request\n\ncurl /payments/pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA/refund \\\n   -u {KEY}:{SECRET} \\\n   -d 'amount=15000' \\\n   -d 'reverse_all=1'\\\n\n{\n  \"amount\": 15000,\n  \"reverse_all\": true\n}\n{\n  \"id\": \"rfnd_6ye1vPrRFo6TdA\",\n  \"entity\": \"refund\",\n  \"amount\": 15000,\n  \"currency\": \"INR\",\n  \"paymentid\": \"pay6ydSup2U7aFMsA\",\n  \"notes\": {},\n  \"created_at\": 1482998305\n}\n\nIn the example given on the side, the amount specified in the amount parameter\n(i.e., 15000) is the amount that will be refunded to the customer.

You can also choose to hold account settlements per transfer or per linked account.\n\nHolding Settlements For Transfers\n\nWhen transferring a payment to an account, you can choose to put the transfer on hold\nindefinitely or until a defined time. These settings can be toggled or modified anytime\nvia the API provided, until the settlement is made. When a transfer is put on hold, the\nsettlement for the linked account is deferred until the hold is released.\n\nThe following parameters can be sent for each transfer in the payment transfer API defined\nabove:\n\nonhold boolean (0 / 1)_\n: If set to 1, the transfer is put on hold and settlement to the linked account is deferred\nuntil the hold is removed.\n(Default: 0).\n For example: Suppose the settlement scheduled for a linked account - acc_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7 was defined as T+10 days, the transfer created with the request defined below will not be settled after 10 days - as long as the hold is maintained. If the hold is disabled on T+15, the amount will be settled to the linked account by the next working day.\n\nonholduntil integer\n: Epoch timestamp. If set, Razorpay will hold the settlement of the transfer to the linked\naccount until the timestamp provided elapses.\n For example: If a transfer is created with onholduntil timestamp defined, we will hold the settlement of this transfer to the linked account until the timestamp defined has elapsed. Once elapsed, the transfer amount will be settled to the linked account by the next working day.\n\nWhen using this parameter, on_hold must be sent and set to 1. Additionally,\nthe timestamp value provided must be greater than the current timestamp.\n\ncurl /payments/pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA/transfer \\\n   -u {KEY}:{SECRET} \\\n   -d 'transfers0=acc_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7' \\\n   -d 'transfers0=10000' \\\n   -d 'transfers0=INR' \\\n   -d 'transfers0=1'\n{\n  \"transfers\": [\n    {\n      \"account\": \"acc_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7\",\n      \"amount\" : 10000,\n      \"on_hold\": true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n{\n  \"entity\": \"collection\",\n  \"count\": 1,\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"trf_6ydVYyzaICeIw5\",\n      \"entity\": \"transfer\",\n      \"source\": \"pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA\",\n      \"recipient\": \"acc_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7\",\n      \"amount\": 10000,\n      \"amount_reversed\": 0,\n      \"on_hold\": true,\n      \"tax\": 16,\n      \"fees\": 4,\n      \"created_at\": 1482996461\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nSettlement Schedule Override\n\nThe settlement schedule defined for the linked account takes higher preference over\nthe onhold and onhold_until functionality. This simply means that defined\nsettlement schedule is the the minimum time required for the transfer to be settled.\n\nExamples:\n\nFor a T+10 settlement schedule -\n\nIf a transfer was created with on_hold=1 and then released on day T+7, the settlement\nwill only go out on day T+10.\nIf a transfer was created with onhold=1 and onhold_until=1491567400 (assume the\ntimestamp 1491567400 corresponds to 7 days after transfer) - then transfer's on_hold\nwill change to false on day T+7, but the settlement will only go out on day T+10.\n\nIn the example request given on the side, a transfer of INR 10000 to accountid acca1b2c3d4e5f6g7\nis created and put on hold.\n\nExample Request\n\ncurl -XPATCH /transfers/trf_6ydVYyzaICeIw5 \\\n   -u {KEY}:{SECRET} \\\n   -d 'on_hold=1'\n\n{\n  \"on_hold\": true\n}\n{\n  \"id\": \"trf_6ydVYyzaICeIw5\",\n  \"entity\": \"transfer\",\n  \"source\": \"pay_714hrl4xiFqxpA\",\n  \"recipient\": \"cust_70dOp5b7dFEeQl\",\n  \"amount\": 10000,\n  \"currency\": \"INR\",\n  \"amount_reversed\": 0,\n  \"on_hold\": true,\n  \"tax\": 16,\n  \"fees\": 4,\n  \"created_at\": 1483528953\n}\n\nModify Transfer Hold\n\n/transfers/:id\n\nThe transfer hold settings can be modified anytime by sending a PATCH request on the transfer_id.\nOn successful request, the API responds with the modified transfer entity.\n\nNote: You cannot change this setting after the transfer has been settled to the linked account.\n","url":"api/route-api"},{"layout":"api","title":"Settlement","index":false,"body":"\nThe following section will explain the settlement entity and their associated API.\n\nSettlement Entity\n\nid string\n: The unique Id of the settlement.

Under this umbrella, BharatQR seems to be the fastest mode for recieving payments.\n\nWhat is BharatQR?\n\nBharatQR is a payment collection method that facilitates merchant-to-person transaction through a QR code.\n\nA QR code is an information matrix in a machine-readable format containing the required details to accept payments from customers. This is how a sample QR code looks like:\n\nHow it Works?\n\nBQR was built from ground up keeping mobility around virtual account transactions at its core,\nthereby making it agnostic across various mobile devices and applications.\n\nIn a BQR-based payment setting, a customer uses a BQR-enabled mobile app to scan a BQR code deployed on the merchant store/location. Upon a successful scan, customer is redirected to a checkout page where the she/he enters the card details and proceeds with the payment for the charged amount. Once the payment is complete, both merchant and customer are notified of the payment status. If the payment is successful, merchant recevies the funds directly in the bank account.\n\n@image bqrgeneralflow.png\n\nThe supported payment schemes include:\nUPI\nCredit and Debit cards\n    Mastercard\n    Visa\n    RuPay\n\n@image bharatqr_2.gif\n\nAdvantages\n\nA BQR code can be thought of as a 2 dimensional barcode but with capability of carrying 10 times more information. BQR code can accomodate a payment details such as business name, merchant's contact, destination bank details, and more. Amongst its many advantages, a BQR payment:\n\nrequires less or no setup cost.\ncharges no additional cost. It is just a new mode of payment.\nis as secure as a UPI payment as your card details are not exposed to a third party.\nis interoperable across most payment apps such as Mobikwik, PhonePe, Google Tez, and others.\n\nUse-cases\n\nBQR-based payments are being widely adopted by many merchants with physical stores as it makes accepting and receiving payments a lot quicker and easier for them. The adoption to BQR based payments may also replace:\n\nCash-on-delivery\nID cards\nPOS machines\nPaper receipts","url":"bharatqr"},{"title":"Notification","desc":"Recieve notifications for your Razorpay virtual account for payment captured event using webhooks and receive email notifications for payment successful event .","body":"\nYou will be notified of any payments made to your virtual accounts via webhook and email.\n\nAll payments made using BharatQR towards your account will show up on your Dashboard as well as in the usual payment API response as payments made with receiver qrcode.

Therefore, if you are using previous versions of Razorpay's Android SDK, you must upgrade to the latest version available on the Maven Repository.\n\nTLS Changes:\nAccording to PCI regulations, payment processing is not allowed on TLS v1. So in case the device does not have TLS v1.1 or TLS v1.2, the SDK will throw an error in the onPaymentError method.\n\nChangelog\nUPI related improvements\nGoogle SMS policy related updates\n\nInstalling the SDK\n\nYou can download the latest versions of the SDK from the Maven Repository.\n\nTo add Razorpay's Checkout SDK to your app, add the following dependency in your build.gradle:\n\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    compile 'com.razorpay:checkout:1.5.2'\n}\n\nInitializing the SDK\n\nAdd your Razorpay API key to the AndroidManifest.xml:\n\n      /**\n       */\n       Add your API key\n       */\n\nImplementing PaymentResultListener\n\nTo receive callbacks for the payment result, implement the method PaymentResultListener:\n\nBackward Compatibility:\nAll the changes mentioned below are backward compatible. If you want to continue using the older structure, you just need to include the latest SDK through the process mentioned above.\n\nHowever, it is highly recommended that you refactor your code to support the latest structure.

Once the payment is complete, the SDK hands over control to a layer that calls these callback methods. Since there are two activities involved, your activity can get garbage collected / destroyed in case the device is low on memory. Hence, these two methods should not depend on any variable that is not set through your life cycle hooks. Enable the \"Don't Keep Activities\" option in Developer Options under Settings.\n\n##!

Refer this list to know about the allowed options.\n\nImplementation details when using Fragment:\nIf you are calling the payment start method from inside a fragment, ensure that the fragment's parent activity implements the PaymentResultListener interface.\n\nError codes\n\nThe error codes that are returned in the onPaymentError method are:\n\nError_Code\nDescription\n\nCheckout.NETWORK_ERROR\nThere was a network error, for example loss of internet connectivity\n\nCheckout.INVALID_OPTIONS\nAn issue with options passed in checkout.open\n\nCheckout.PAYMENT_CANCELED\nUser cancelled the payment\n\nCheckout.TLS_ERROR\nDevice does not support TLS v1.1 or TLS v1.2\n\nOverride the minimum API level\nThis version of Checkout Android SDK is compatible with Android version \"19\" or higher. Therefore, your app should support  Android version 19 or higher. Nonetheless, if you want to use versions lower than 19.0 in your app, you can override the minimum value of the SDK version as shown below:\n\nCustomization Options\n\nYou can customize the checkout form to suit your organization as shown below:\n\nAdding the Company Logo\n\nBy default, the Checkout form uses the logo specified on the Dashboard. You can also set a custom logo in the Checkout form. For this you need to call the following method before you call open method.\n\nint image = R.drawable.logo; // Can be any drawable\ncheckout.setImage(image);\n\nIf you pass both, image in options as well as through this method, the image from drawables is picked up.\n\nDisabling Checkout in Full screen\n\nThe Checkout form runs in a separate activity. This activity picks up the theme from the Manifest file. So if you have a full screen theme, even the Checkout will run in full screen. It is suggested to disable the Checkout in full screen mode to enable the user to switch between various apps, for example, while entering the OTP.\n\nIf your app is in a full screen mode, you can disable it for Checkout by calling the following method:\n\ncheckout.setFullScreenDisable(true)\n\nErase User Data from SDK\n\nThe SDK stores specific data of the user such as email, contact number, and user-session cookies, in case the user wants to make another payment in the same session. You might want to delete the sensitive information before another user logs into the app.\n\nTo erase user data from the app, you can call the following method anywhere in your app.\n\nCheckout.clearUserData(Context)\n\nProguard rules\n\nIf you are using Proguard for your builds, modify the build file:\n\n-keepclassmembers class * {\n    @android.webkit.JavascriptInterface ;\n}\n\n-keepattributes JavascriptInterface\n-keepattributes Annotation\n\n-dontwarn com.razorpay.**\n-keep class com.razorpay.* {;}\n\n-optimizations !method/inlining/*\n\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  public void onPayment*(...);\n}\n\nNote: You can get in touch with us at https://razorpay.com/support for any queries.\n","url":"checkout/android"},{"title":"Callback URL","index":false,"body":"\nIf you reuse your web integration of Razorpay Checkout inside a webview on Android or iOS, the checkout form may not open. All issues like this are handled in our Android and iOS SDK, with the SDK being the preferred method of integration.\n\nHowever, if you want to reuse the web integration for some reason, you can pass the following callback_url along with other checkout options to process the desired payment:\n\nvar options = {\n  ... // existing options\n  callbackurl: 'https://your-server/callbackurl'\n}\n\ncallbackurl needs to accept incoming POST requests. For a successful payment, the callback URL will have razorpaypaymentid, razorpayorderid and razorpaysignature as the request parameters.\n\nFor failed payments, the request parameter are explained in the table below:\n\nParameter\nPresent\nExample Value\n\nerror\nArray, always present\n\nerror[code]\nAlways present\nBADREQUESTERROR\n\nerror[description]\nAlways present\nPayment failed due to incorrect card number\n\nerror[field]\nPresent if payment fails due to basic validation error.\ncard[number]\n\nNote:\nYou can set query parameters with callbackurl, to map it with entities at your side.

After you integrate, follow the steps given below:\n\nAdd a key external to checkout.js options.\n\nSet wallets with wallet name array in external as the first parameter.\n\n      external: {\n      wallets: ['paytm']\n    }\n\nSet handler with a callback function in exteranl as second parameter. This is where you receive a callback from which you can handle external wallets, based on the parameters:\n\n      external: {\n      wallets: ['paytm'],\n      handler: function(data) {\n         'data'\n        console.log(this, data)\n      }\n    }\n\nThe external wallet sent in options will be shown in the wallets section. If the customer selects external wallet and clicks Submit, our checkout.js library will return the control to you in the external:handler: method. You will get the selected wallet name as an argument. You will now have to handle the external payment method.\n\nAndroid\n\nTo list external wallet on your Android app, you need to first integrate our Android checkout SDK. After you integrate our Android checkout, follow the steps given below:\n\nImplement ExternalWalletListener in your activity.\n\n        public class PaymentActivity extends Activity implements PaymentResultListener, ExternalWalletListener {\n        //..\n\n        @Override\n    \tpublic void onExternalWalletSelected(String walletName, PaymentData paymentData){\n\t\t\t// add your logic here to handle external wallet payments like\n\t\t\tif(walletName.equals(\"paytm\"){\n\t\t\t    //handle paytm payment\n\t\t\t}\n\n    \t}\n\n    }\n\nSend external wallet information to checkout in options. You can send it in the following way:\n\n        JSONArray wallets = new JSONArray();\n    wallets.put(\"paytm\");\n    JSONObject externals = new JSONObject();\n    externals.put(\"wallets\", wallets);\n    options.put(\"external\", externals);\n    The external wallet sent in options will be shown in wallets section. If the customer selects an external wallet and submits it, our SDK will return control to you in the onExternalWalletSelected method. You will get the selected wallet name as an argument. You will now have to handle your payment.\n\niOS\n\nTo list external wallet on your iOS app, you need to first setup your framework. Download the Razorpay.framework-0.14.11 from here.\n\nYour next step is to integrate the Bitcode enabled SDK. Refer Razorpay iOS Integration for integration. Once you are done with that, you can follow the steps given below:\n\nImplement ExternalWalletSelectionProtocol in your view controller.\n\n        @interface ViewController ()  {\n\nSet  ExternalWalletSelectionDelegate to get callback in delegate method.\n\n        [razorpay setExternalWalletSelectionDelegate:self];\n\nSend external wallet information to Checkout in options.

The form options are passed as data attributes inside a ` tag. Once the payment is successfully authorized, a response object containing razorpaypaymentid, razorpayorderid and razorpay_signature` gets auto-submitted to the URL set in the form action.\n\nThis response object can be utilized to verify the Razorpay signature and capture the payment]().\n\nYou can add any additional hidden (or visible) fields to the form, which will be submitted along with the form.\n\nThe below sample code will pass the options as HTML data-attributes for an amount  of @data.Rs 200:\n\nNote: The amount must always be in paisa. In the above example, an amount  of @data.Rs 200 is specified in paise as amount 2000.\n\nCheckout Fields\nThe checkout fields used in the automatic checkout is explained in the table below:\n\nField Name\nRequired\nDescription\n\ndata-key\nYes\nMerchant Key-Id\n\ndata-amount\nYes\nPayment amount in Paisa (INR).

We also have a CocoaPod for our SDK (non bitcode enabled).\nOpen your project in XCode and select Add files to \"yourproject\" from file menu.\nSelect Razorpay.framework in the directory you just unzipped.\nEnsure that you have selected Copy items if needed option.\nClick Add.\nIn the Build Settings tab of your project settings, -ObjC flag should be present under Other Linker Flags.\nUnder Link Binary With Libraries in the Build Settings tab of your project settings, add CoreTelephony.framework and SystemConfiguration.framework.\n\nStep 2: Initialize Razorpay SDK\n\nYou will need your public key and delegate that implements RazorpayPaymentCompletionProtocol and view controller where you want to show the checkout form.\n\n#import\n\n@interface ViewController ()  {\n  Razorpay *razorpay;\n..\n..\n\n// Any place before opening the checkout form (eg. viewDidLoad)\n(void)viewDidLoad {\n  [super viewDidLoad];\n  ..\n  ..\n  razorpay = [Razorpay initWithKey:@\"YOURPUBLICKEY\" andDelegate:self];\n}\nStep 3: Pass payment options and show checkout form\n\nAdd following code to in your ViewController or where ever you want to initialize payments:\n\n(void)showPaymentForm { // called by your app\n  NSDictionary *options = @{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@\"amount\": @\"1000\", // mandatory, in paise\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      // all optional other than amount.\n            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@\"image\": @\"https://url-to-image.png\",\n      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@\"name\": @\"business or product name\",\n      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@\"description\": @\"purchase description\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@\"prefill\" : @{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@\"email\": @\"pranav@razorpay.com\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@\"contact\": @\"8879524924\"\n                            \t\t},\n      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@\"theme\": @{\n                                  \t@\"color\": @\"#F37254\"\n                                }\n                        \t\t};\n\t\t[razorpay open:options];\nYou can find the list of all supported options here.\n\n Progress Bar: To support theme color in progress bar, please pass HEX color values only.\n\nStep 4: Handle success/error when payment is done\n\nThis is done by implementing onPaymentSuccess and onPaymentError methods of the RazorpayPaymentCompletionProtocol:\n\n(void)onPaymentSuccess:(nonnull NSString*)payment_id {\n    \t[[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Payment Successful\" message:payment_id delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@\"OK\" otherButtonTitles:nil] show];\n}\n\n(void)onPaymentError:(int)code description:(nonnull NSString *)str {\n    \t[[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Error\" message:str delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@\"OK\" otherButtonTitles:nil] show];\n}\nHere, you have to add necessary actions after payment is completed based on success/error.\nPossible values for failure code are:\n0: Network error\n1: Initialization failure due to invalid options passed\n2: Payment cancelled by user\n\nSuccess handler will receive payment_id which you can use later for capturing purposes.\n\nYou can call open method any number of times. (eg. in case of payment failure, customer might want to retry so you can call the open method with same / different options based on your use case)\n\niOS 9 Update\n\niOS 9 has higher requirements for secure URLs.\nUnfortunately, many of Indian banks do not adhere to it,\nwhich leaves you with following workaround for time being:\n\nNSAppTransportSecurity\n\n    NSAllowsArbitraryLoads\n\nAdd it to your info.plist file. more info can be found on developer.apple.com\n\nWorking with Swift\nYou can easily use the SDK with swift using Objective-C Bridging Header. You can refer Apple's documentation on the same as well.\n\nTo begin, create a new file (File > New > File > iOS > Source > Header File) and name it YourProjectName-Bridging-Header.h. Open the file and insert following line to it:\n\n#import\n\nNext, go to your project's build settings, and type bridging to filter options. Look for an option named Objective-C Bridging Header and set its value to path of your file. It appears as shown below:\n\n@image ios-integration.png\n\nThen in your ViewController, setup the SDK as follows:\n\nclass ViewController: UIViewController, RazorpayPaymentCompletionProtocol.. {\n\n    private var razorpay : Razorpay!\n    ..\n    ..\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        ..\n        ..\n        razorpay = Razorpay.initWithKey(\"YOURPUBLICKEY\", andDelegate: self)\n    }\nWhen you want to open the checkout form:\n\nfunc showPaymentForm() {\n        let options = [\n            \"amount\" : \"2000\" // and all other options\n        ]\n        razorpay.open(options)\n    }\nYou also need to implement necessary success/failure actions as shown below:\n\nfunc onPaymentSuccess(payment_id: String) {\n        UIAlertView.init(title: \"Payment Successful\", message: payment_id, delegate: self, cancelButtonTitle: \"OK\").show()\n    }\n\n    func onPaymentError(code: Int32, description str: String) {\n        UIAlertView.init(title: \"Error\", message: str, delegate: self, cancelButtonTitle: \"OK\").show()\n    }\n","url":"checkout/ios-checkout-sdk-v0.1.4.1"},{"title":"Checkout - iOS SDK","index":false,"body":"\nThe iOS SDK library lets you seamlessly integrate the entire payment ecosystem in your iOS application and start accepting payments with Razorpay.\n\nNote: We have moved our SDKs to Swift framework.

We have ensured that you would not have to change anything in your code when you will move from Objective-C library to our new Swift framework. If you wish to use the older version, you can find the documentation here.\n\nFollowing are the two versions of our framework:\n\nRazorpay | 1.0.11\nRazorpay | 1.0.12\n\nSDK | Framework Version | Framework Compiled With | Download Link\n\nRazorpay(with bit code enabled) | 1.0.12 | Swift 4.1 | Click here.\n\nRazorpay(with bit code enabled) | 1.0.11 | Swift 3.1 | Click here.\n\nStep 1: Importing the Library\n\nFor cocoapod users , our cocoapod page is CocoaPod (bitcode enabled).\n\nFollow the instruction given below to import the SDK library to your Swift or Objective-C project:\n\nFor Swift:\n\nDownload the SDK from above and unzip it.\nOpen your project in XCode and go to file under Menu. Select Add files to \"yourproject\".\nSelect Razorpay.framework in the directory you just unzipped.\nSelect the Copy items if needed check-box.\nClick Add.\nNavigate to Target settings > General and add the Razorpay.framework in both Embeded Binaries and Linked Frameworks and Libraries.\n\nFor Objective-C:\n\nDownload the SDK from above and unzip it.\nOpen your project in XCode and go to file under Menu.

Alternatively, you can also implement onPaymentSuccess and onPaymentError methods of RazorpayPaymentCompletionProtocolWithData.\n\npublic func onPaymentError(_ code: Int32, description str: String){\n    let alertController = UIAlertController(title: \"FAILURE\", message: str, preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.alert)\n    let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: \"OK\", style: UIAlertActionStyle.cancel, handler: nil)\n    alertController.addAction(cancelAction)\n    self.view.window?.rootViewController?.present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)\n}\n\npublic func onPaymentSuccess(_ payment_id: String){\n    let alertController = UIAlertController(title: \"SUCCESS\", message: \"Payment Id \\(payment_id)\", preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.alert)\n    let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: \"OK\", style: UIAlertActionStyle.cancel, handler: nil)\n    alertController.addAction(cancelAction)\n    self.view.window?.rootViewController?.present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)\n}\n\n(void)onPaymentSuccess:(nonnull NSString*)payment_id {\n      [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Payment Successful\" message:payment_id delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@\"OK\" otherButtonTitles:nil] show];\n}\n\n(void)onPaymentError:(int)code description:(nonnull NSString *)str {\n      [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Error\" message:str delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@\"OK\" otherButtonTitles:nil] show];\n}\n\nHere you have to put necessary actions after payment is completed based on success/error.\n\nPossible values for failure code are:\n0: Network error\n1: Initialization failure / Unexpected behaviour\n2: Payment cancelled by user\n\nSuccess handler will receive payment_id which you can use later for capturing purposes.\n\niOS 9 Update\n\nThe iOS 9 has higher requirements for secure URLs. As many Indian banks do not comply with the requirements, you can implement the following as a workaround:\n\nNSAppTransportSecurity\n\n    NSAllowsArbitraryLoads\n\nAdd the above to your info.plist file.

It works in conjunction with Orders API that gets called whenever an order is created at the server side.\n\nWe support the following checkout methods:\n\nAutomatic Checkout\nManual Checkout\n\nNote: Before you start using the checkout.js, include ` in the ` section of your page, in order to correctly render the checkout form modal.\n\nCheckout Fields\nThe checkout fields used in the both checkout methods are explained in the table below:\n\nField Name (Manua)\nField Name (Automatic)\nRequired\nDescription\n\nkey\ndata-key\nYes\nMerchant Key-Id\n\namount\ndata-amount\nYes\nPayment amount in Paisa (INR). Accepted datatype is integer. For example, if the amount is @data.Rs 100, it means data-amount=\"10000\".\n\nname\ndata-name\nYes\nThe merchant/company name shown in checkout form.\n\ndescription\ndata-description\nNo\nDescription of the item purchased shown in the checkout form. Must start with an alphanumeric character.\n\nimage\ndata-image\nNo\nLink to an image (usually merchant's logo) shown in the checkout form. Can also be a base64 string, if loading image from network is not desirable.\n\nprefill.name\ndata-prefill.name\nNo\nCardholder name to be pre-filled at the time of checkout opening.\n\nprefill.email\ndata-prefill.email\nNo\nCustomer's email to be pre-filled on the checkout form at the time of checkout opening.\n\nprefill.contact\ndata-prefill.contact\nNo\nCustomer's phone number to be pre-filled at the time of checkout opening.\n\nprefill.method\ndata-prefill.method\nNo\nPre-selection of the payment method for the customer. It can be card/netbanking/wallet/emi/upi. However, it will only work if contact and email are also pre-filled.\n\nnotes.fieldname\ndata-notes.fieldname\nNo\nAny additional fields you want to associate with the payment. For example, \"shipping address\". Upto 15 note fields can be specified in this way.\n\ntheme.color\ndata-theme.color\nNo\nBrand color to alter the appearance of checkout form.\n\ntheme.image_padding\ndata-theme.image_padding\nNo\nThis field accepts a Boolean value on whether to show an image inside a white frame. Defaults to true.\n\nmodal.backdropclose\ndata-modal.backdropclose\nNo\nThis field accepts a Boolean value indicating whether clicking the translucent blank space outside checkout form should close the form. Defaults to false.\n\nmodal.escape\ndata-modal.escape\nNo\nThis field accepts a Boolean value indicating whether pressing escape key should close the checkout form. Defaults to true.\n\norder_id\ndata-order_id\nNo\nOrder ID generated via Orders API.\n\nAutomatic Checkout\n\nThe automatic checkout method provides a default Razorpay Pay with Razorpay button that invokes Razorpay checkout form. The form options are passed as data attributes inside a ` tag. Once the payment is successfully authorized, a response object containing razorpaypaymentid, razorpayorderid and razorpay_signature` gets auto-submitted to the URL set in the form action.\n\nThis response object can be utilized for Payment Verification and payment Capturing.\n\nYou can add any additional hidden (or visible) fields to the form, which will be submitted along with the form.\n\nThe sample code given below will pass the options as HTML data-attributes for an amount  of @data.Rs 299.35:\n\nNote: You can customise the appearance of the Pay Now with Razorpay button by writing css rules against razorpaypaymentbutton. This can be done in Manual checkout method as well.\n\nManual Checkout\n\nIn manual checkout method, the checkout form is invoked by the custom button on your site and the form options are passed as variables in a key-value pair format within a ` tag. Once the payment is successfully authorized, a handler function is called automatically. This function returns a response object containing razorpaypaymentid, razorpayorderid and razorpay_signature. This handler` function must be called back to your server-side for capturing the payment.\n\nNote: The checkout.js library is used for web based integration. For Cordova/Phonegap/Ionic, check out our Cordova SDK. For mobile apps, use our Android/iOS SDK instead.\n\nThe sample code given below will pass the form options for an amount of @data.Rs 299.35:\n\nPay\n\nvar options = {\n    \"key\": \"rzptest32hsbEKriO6ai4\",\n    \"amount\": \"29935\", // INR 299.35\n    \"name\": \"Acme Corp\",\n    \"description\": \"A Wild Sheep Chase is the third novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami\",\n    \"image\": \"https://example.com/your_logo\",\n    \"handler\": function (response){\n        alert(response.razorpaypaymentid);\n    },\n    \"prefill\": {\n        \"name\": \"Gaurav Kumar\",\n        \"email\": \"gaurav.kumar@razorpay.com\"\n    },\n    \"notes\": {\n        \"address\": \"note value\"\n    },\n    \"theme\": {\n        \"color\": \"#F37254\"\n    }\n};\nvar rzp1 = new Razorpay(options);\ndocument.getElementById('rzp-button1').onclick = function(e){\n    rzp1.open();\n    e.preventDefault();\n}\n\nNote: The open method of Razorpay object (rzp1.open()) must be invoked by your site's JavaScript on a user-driven action, such as a click.\n\nAdditional Features\n\nWe also provide certain additional features along with the checkout form such as:\n\nSwitching between Methods\n\nIf you are unsure about which checkout method to use for different scenarios, you can easily switch from manual checkout method to automatic. This is possible as our checkout.js searches for the data-key field inside the ` tag which when found, the script switches to automatic mode. It also creates a button alongside the  tag and attaches its onclick event handler (created internally) to the .open` method of the Razorpay object.\n\nTracking the Modal\n\nTo track the lifecycle of the checkout modal, you can pass a modal object with ondismiss: function(){} as options. The ondismiss function is called when the modal is closed by the user.\n\nNote: This feature is only supported in manual checkout.\n\nA below JavaScript code explains the usage of the ondismiss: function(){}:\n\nvar options = {\n    \"key\": \"rzptest32hsbEKriO6ai4\",\n    \"amount\": \"29935\",\n    \"name\": \"Acme Corp\",\n    \"description\": \"A Wild Sheep Chase is the third novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami\",\n    \"image\": \"http://example.com/your_logo.png\",\n    \"handler\": function (response){\n        alert(response.razorpaypaymentid);\n    },\n    /**\n       You can track the modal lifecycle by adding the below code in your options\n       */\n    \"modal\": {\n        \"ondismiss\": function(){\n            console.log(‘Checkout form closed’);\n        }\n    }\n};\nvar rzp1 = new Razorpay(options);\n\nYou can utilize the handler function, called on every successful transaction, for tracking the end of a payment.\n\nEMI Option\n\nRazorpay Checkout supports EMI options for customers. The EMI option is automatically handled without requiring you to do anything different. Currently, the EMI option is available within the Card button itself. However, to display EMI tab as a separate payment method, you can use the parameter theme.emi_mode: true.\n\nFetching EMI Plans\n\nThere might be cases when you have to display the available EMI plans on the site, and not only in the checkout systems. In such cases, you can use Razorpay checkout helper methods to fetch the details of the EMI plans and display it on your site. You can use the event ready, as shown below:\n\nvar razorpay = new Razorpay(...); // as before\n\n    /**\n       The above code remains the same.\n       You can fetch the available EMI plans by adding the below code in your options.\n       */\nrazorpay.once('ready', function() {\n  console.log(razorpay.methods.emi_plans);\n  console.log(razorpay.methods.netbanking);\n})\n\n{\n  \"HDFC\": {\n    \"min_amount\": 300000,\n    \"plans\": {\n      \"3\": 12,\n      \"6\": 12,\n      \"9\": 13,\n      \"12\": 13,\n      \"18\": 15,\n      \"24\": 15\n    }\n  },\n  \"AMEX\": {\n    \"min_amount\": 500000,\n    \"plans\": {\n      \"3\": 15,\n      \"6\": 15,\n      \"9\": 15,\n      \"12\": 15\n    }\n  }\n  // etc..\n}\n\nrazorpay.methods.emi_plans string\n: Lists the EMI-supported banks with its respective interest rates.\n\nrazorpay.methods.netbanking\nstring\n: Contains the list of all banks and bank-codes.\n\nCalculating EMI\n\nYou can utilize the function Razorpay.emi.calculator to calculate installment amounts, as shown below:\n\nRazorpay.emi.calculator(principleamount, durationinmonth, annualinterest_rate);\n\nThe below code will calculate EMI for a principle amount of 10000 (@data.100) over 12 months with an annual interest rate of 9%:\n\nRazorpay.emi.calculator(10000, 12, 9);\n= 874\n\nNote:The above code does not do any unit conversion of the principal amount. The returned amount will have the same unit as the principle. If the principle amount is in paisa, returned EMI amount will also be in paisa.\n\nCallback URL\n\nIf you reuse your web integration of Razorpay Checkout inside a webview on Android or iOS, the checkout form may not open. All issues like this are handled in our Android and iOS SDK, with the SDK being the preferred method of integration.\n\nHowever, if you want to reuse the web integration for some reason, you can pass the following callback_url along with other checkout options to process the desired payment:\n\nvar options = {\n  ... // existing options\n  callbackurl: 'https://your-server/callbackurl'\n}\n\ncallbackurl needs to accept incoming POST requests. For a successful payment, the callback URL will have razorpaypaymentid, razorpayorderid and razorpaysignature as the request parameters.\n\nFor failed payments, the request parameter are explained in the table below:\n\nParameter\nPresent\nExample Value\n\nerror\nArray, always present\n\nerror[code]\nAlways present\nBADREQUESTERROR\n\nerror[description]\nAlways present\nPayment failed due to incorrect card number\n\nerror[field]\nPresent if payment fails due to basic validation error.\ncard[number]\n\nNote:\nYou can set query parameters with callbackurl, to map it with entities at your side. For example, following is a valid callback URL: https://your-site.com/callback?cartid=12345\n","url":"checkout/web-integration"},{"title":"Tokens","index":false,"body":"\nThis page has moved to: https://razorpay.com/docs/private/tokens","url":"create-tokens"},{"title":"Disputes","desc":"You can create chargeback and disputes on Razorpay Dashboard for your customers and learn about the proofs required by the issuing bank.","body":"A dispute is a situation that arises when your customer or the issuing bank questions the validity of a payment. It could arise due to reasons such as unauthorised charges, failure to deliver the promised merchandise, excessive charges and so on.\n\nTypes of Disputes\n\nA dispute can be of the following different types:\n\nFraud : It is a dispute that gets raised when the issuing bank suspects a transaction to be fraudulent based on the risk analysis.\nRetrieval : A retrieval is a request, initiated by the customer with their issuer bank for more information about a transaction. This is essentially a soft chargeback.\nChargeback : A claim raised against a transaction, initiated by the customers with their issuer bank, for a refund. The bank starts an official enquiry in this case.\nPre-Arbitration : When a chargeback that you have won is challenged by the customer for the second time.\nArbitration : When a chargeback that you have won is challenged for a third time by the customer and the card networks directly get involved. These disputes are usually very expensive.\n\nNote: The pre-arbitration and arbitration phases are usually long-drawn, complicated and challenging. It is advised to take remedial action during the retrievals and chargebacks phase itself to avoid further complication.\n\nDisputes Process Flow\n\nThe overall flow in which disputes are raised is given below:\n\nA dispute is always raised by the issuing bank. However, it can be initiated by the bank or the customer.\n\tInitiated by the issuing bank - The issuing bank suspects a fraudulent transaction and asks the merchant for justification.\n\tInitiated by the customer: The customer claims that the transaction was unauthorized and raises it with the issuing bank.\n\nThe merchant gets notified about the dispute and can do one of the following:\n\tAccept: If the merchant feels that the dispute is legitimate, the dispute request can be accepted. In the case of a fraud, the merchant must refund the amount. In other cases, Razorpay will auto-refund the amount.\n\tContest: If the merchant feels that the dispute is not legitimate, the dispute can be contested. In this case, the merchant submits the relevant documents to prove that the transaction was fair.\n\nIf the merchant contests, the documents are sent to the customer’s bank. The bank reviews the case and provides a verdict.\n\nIf the merchant loses, the amount would be deducted from the merchant’s account and is sent to the customer.\n\nSubmitting Evidences\n\nIf you are contesting a dispute and sending proofs, the following evidences may be required. This list is not exhaustive and the actual proofs required will depend on the customer's issuing bank:\n\nMerchant's explanation letter\nCustomer's recall letter\nOrder/Service confirmation\nRefund confirmation\nOrder/service cancelled\nDelivery proof\nShipping proof\nAccess activity log (any server or activity logs proving that the customer accessed or downloaded the purchased digital product).","url":"disputes"},{"title":"Related Information","desc":"View the status of disputes on the Razorpay Dashboard, enable webhooks when disputes are created and recieve email notification.","body":"\nYou can view disputes, track its status on the Razorpay Dashboard and recieve notifications in the form of emails and webhook alerts.\n\nViewing Disputes\n\nYou can view the disputes raised against a charge on the Razorpay Dashboard.

After you integrate, follow the steps given below:\n\nAdd a key external to checkout.js options.\n\nSet wallets with wallet name array in external as the first parameter.\n\n      external: {\n      wallets: ['paytm']\n    }\n\nSet handler with a callback function in exteranl as second parameter. This is where you receive a callback from which you can handle external wallets, based on the parameters:\n\n      external: {\n      wallets: ['paytm'],\n      handler: function(data) {\n         'data'\n        console.log(this, data)\n      }\n    }\n\nThe external wallet sent in options will be shown in the wallets section. If the customer selects external wallet and clicks Submit, our checkout.js library will return the control to you in the external:handler: method. You will get the selected wallet name as an argument. You will now have to handle the external payment method.\n\nAndroid\n\nTo list external wallet on your Android app, you need to first integrate our Android checkout SDK. After you integrate our Android checkout, follow the steps given below:\n\nImplement ExternalWalletListener in your activity.\n\n        public class PaymentActivity extends Activity implements PaymentResultListener, ExternalWalletListener {\n        //..\n\n        @Override\n    \tpublic void onExternalWalletSelected(String walletName, PaymentData paymentData){\n\t\t\t// add your logic here to handle external wallet payments like\n\t\t\tif(walletName.equals(\"paytm\"){\n\t\t\t    //handle paytm payment\n\t\t\t}\n\n    \t}\n\n    }\n\nSend external wallet information to checkout in options.

If the customer selects an external wallet and submits it, our SDK will return control to you in the onExternalWalletSelected method. You will get the selected wallet name as an argument. You will now have to handle your payment.\n\niOS\n\nTo list external wallet on your iOS app, you need to first setup your framework. Download the Razorpay.framework-0.14.11 from here.\n\nYour next step is to integrate the Bitcode enabled SDK. Refer Razorpay iOS Integration for integration. Once you are done with that, you can follow the steps given below:\n\nImplement ExternalWalletSelectionProtocol in your view controller.\n\n        @interface ViewController ()  {\n\nSet  ExternalWalletSelectionDelegate to get callback in delegate method.\n\n        [razorpay setExternalWalletSelectionDelegate:self];\n\nSend external wallet information to Checkout in options.

So when you\nsend lineitems array, you would be replacing current set of lineitems with the new set. Given that, you\nmay do something like following: keep some(optionally with updated values) of the existing line items(by line_item's id\nin dictionary with other optional attributes), remove some of the existing line_items(by not having them in new set at all) and add\nsome new line items by passing new dictionary in same line_items array(or list).\n\nFor example, in Request #1 - lineitems with id li00000000000001 will be patched with the updated name and quantity,\na new lineitems would be added (the second dictionary in the lineitems array) and all other existing would be removed.\n\nIssuing an Invoice\n\nYou can issues an invoice in draft state. A short URL or payment link gets created only\nwhen the invoice is in issued state. Only then can the customer proceed with the payment.\n\nThe following endpoint can be used to issue an invoice:\n\n/invoices/:id/issue\n\nIt can only be called on an invoice that is in the draft state.\nIts response is the invoice entity, similar to create/update API response. Its status now would be issued\nand it'll have short_url generated. Also SMS and Email would be sent to customer based on what parameters were\nsent initially during creation.\n\nDeleting an Invoice\n\nTo delete an invoice use this endpoint:\n\nYou can delete an invoice which is in the draft state.\n\n/invoices/:id\n\nThe response is always be an empty array, as shown below:\n\n[]\n\nCancelling an Invoice\n\nTo cancel an unpaid Invoice with given ID via API, use this endpoint:\n\n/invoices/:id/cancel\n\nIt can only be called on an invoice that is not in the paid state.\nThe response for the API will be the invoice entity, similar to create/update API response, with status\nattribute's value as cancelled.\n\nGetting an Invoice\n\nTo search an invoice via API with given ID, use this endpoint:\n\n/invoices/:id\n\nThe response for the API will be similar to the entity as detailed here.\n\nFetching Multiple Invoices\n\nYou can fetch multiple invoices using the following end point:\n\n/invoices\n\nAccepted Query

What should I do?\n\nWhen a framework is distributed, it contains architectures of the simulators so that the consumer of the framework can build it on a simulator.\n\nHowever, when you upload the archive on iTunes, you have to strip these architectures.\n\nFollow the below mentioned steps to strip these architectures:\n\nDownload the script.\nLocate the directory in which Razorpay.framework is present in the archive that you are trying to upload.\nMove the attached script in the above directory and run it.\nRemove the script file.\n\nAlternatively, you are using cocoapods to build your app. It strips the simulator architectures on it's own.\n\nI am seeing a message on the screen to update my SDK. Will my customers also see the message?\n\nNo.\n\nYou are seeing the update SDK alert because a newer version of our SDK is available. It is highly recommended that you always use the latest SDK.\n\nThis message appears only when you run the app on a simulator or are using a test key to initialize the SDK.\n\nI am getting an error Image not loaded: .dyld. What should I do ?\n\nPlease ensure that Razorpay.framework is present in both the Embedded Binaries and Linked Frameworks in your project settings.\n\nAlso ensure that Always Embed Swift Libraries is set to yes in the project settings.\n\nNote:\nThis issue might also arise because the Swift version with which Razorpay.framework is developed and the Swift version of your project are not compatible. We highly recommend you to use the framework compiled with the required Swift language from our iOS documentation.\n\nRazorpay's framework is bitcode enabled. Do I also have to enable bitcode in my project?\n\nIf you have or do not have bitcode enabled project, you can use our bitcode enabled framework. There will be no issue and our bitcode enabled framework works in both the cases.\n\nI am getting an error Module compiled with Swift X version cannot be imported in Swift Y version. What should I do?\n\nThere are multiple Swift versions available. Unfortunately, Apple does not make all the versions compatible with each other. This is why we release frameworks compiled in multiple Swift versions. Download the framework that is compatible with your project.\n\nIf you run into a compatibility issue, ensure that you try both the frameworks.\n\nIm getting an error saying Could not find module RazorpayCommonCrypto.\n\nA module map is used to define the header files that should be converted into modules and used by your project.\n\nRazorpay handles this internally. The reason you are facing this issue is because we have made an assumption that your default Xcode's name is Xcode.app, which might not be the case always. For example, your default Xcode might be named Xcode9.3.\n\nTo resolve this issue, simply insert this script in the directory that contains Razorpay.framework file and run it from your terminal and your good to go.\n","url":"ios/faq"},{"title":"Checkout - iOS SDK","desc":"Learn how to integrate Razorpay's payment system with your iOS application to start accepting payments.","body":"\nThe iOS SDK library lets you seamlessly integrate Razorpay's entire payment ecosystem in your iOS application and start accepting payments.\n\nNote:\n\nWe have moved our SDKs to Swift framework. This framework only supports iOS version 10.0 and above. Public contracts have not been changed.\n\nWe have ensured that you will not have to change anything in your code when you move from the Objective-C library to our new Swift framework. If you wish to use the older version, the documentation is available here.\n\nNote:\n\nWe no longer support Swift 3, moving forward only the latest version of Swift will be supported.\n\nDownload the SDK\n\nSDK | Framework Version | Framework Compiled With | Download Link\n\nRazorpay(with bit code enabled) | 1.0.28 | Swift 4.2.1 | Link\n\nStep 1: Import the Library\n\nFor cocoapod users, our cocoapod page can be found here (bitcode enabled).\n\nTo import the SDK library to your Swift or Objective-C project:\n\nFor Swift:\n\nDownload and unzip the SDK.\nOpen your project in XCode and go to file under Menu.\nSelect Add files to \"yourproject\".\nSelect Razorpay.framework in the directory you just unzipped.\nCheck the Copy items if needed check-box.\nClick Add.\nNavigate to Target settings and then to General and add the Razorpay.framework in both Embeded Binaries and Linked Frameworks and Libraries.\n\nFor Objective-C:\n\nDownload and unzip the SDK.\nOpen your project in XCode and go to file under Menu.\nSelect Add files to \"yourproject\".\nSelect Razorpay.framework in the directory you just unzipped.\nCheck the Copy items if needed check-box.\nClick Add.\nNavigate to Target settings and then to General and add the Razorpay.framework in both Embeded Binaries and Linked Frameworks and Libraries.\nGo to Project Settings.\nSelect Build Settings -

General.\n\nStep 2: Initialize the Razorpay SDK\n\nTo initialize the Razorpay SDK, you will need the following:\nAPI key\nA delegate that implements RazorpayPaymentCompletionProtocol or RazorpayPaymentCompletionProtocolWithData\n\nimport Razorpay\nclass ViewController: UIViewController, RazorpayPaymentCompletionProtocol {\n\n\tvar razorpay: Razorpay!\n\t.\n\t.\n\toverride func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        .\n        .\n        razorpay = Razorpay.initWithKey(razorpayTestKey, andDelegate: self)\n    }\n    .\n    .\n}\n\n#import\n@interface ViewController ()  {\n  Razorpay *razorpay;\n\t.\n\t.\n\t(void)viewDidLoad {\n  \t\t[super viewDidLoad];\n  \t\t.\n  \t\t.\n  \t\trazorpay = [Razorpay initWithKey:@\"YOURPUBLICKEY\" andDelegate:self];\n\t}\n}\n\nStep 3: Pass Payment Options and Display Checkout Form\n\nAdd the following code to your ViewController or where ever you want to initialize payments:\n\ninternal func showPaymentForm(){\n\tlet options: [String:Any] = [\n\t\t\t\t\"amount\" : \"100\" //mandatory in paise\n            \t\"description\": \"purchase description\"\n            \t\"image\": \"https://url-to-image.png\",\n            \t\"name\": \"business or product name\"\n            \t\"prefill\": [\n                \t\"contact\": \"9797979797\",\n                \t\"email\": \"foo@bar.com\"\n                ],\n                \"theme\": [\n                    \"color\": \"#F37254\"\n              \t]\n        \t]\n\trazorpay.open(options)\n}\n\n(void)showPaymentForm { // called by your app\n  NSDictionary *options = @{\n                            @\"amount\": @\"1000\", // mandatory, in paise\n                            // all optional other than amount.\n                            @\"image\": @\"https://url-to-image.png\",\n                            @\"name\": @\"business or product name\",\n                            @\"description\": @\"purchase description\",\n                            @\"prefill\" : @{\n                                @\"email\": @\"foo@bar.com\",\n                                @\"contact\": @\"9797979797\"\n                            },\n                            @\"theme\": @{\n                                @\"color\": @\"#F37254\"\n                            }\n                        };\n    [razorpay open:options];\n}\n\nNOTE:\n\nWe now support another optional parameter to the open method displayController.\n\nWhen this parameter is specified, the razorpay controller is pushed on to this controller's navigation controller if present or presented on this controller if absent.\n\nFor example the swift call is:\n\nrazorpay.open(options, displayController: self)\n\nYou can find the list of all supported options here.\n\nProgress Bar:\n\nTo support theme color in the progress bar, pass HEX color values only.\n\nStep 4: Handle Success and Errors\n\nYou can handle success/errors when a payment is completed by implementing onPaymentSuccess and onPaymentError methods of the RazorpayPaymentCompletionProtocol.\n\nAlternatively, you can also implement onPaymentSuccess and onPaymentError methods of RazorpayPaymentCompletionProtocolWithData.\n\npublic func onPaymentError(_ code: Int32, description str: String){\n    let alertController = UIAlertController(title: \"FAILURE\", message: str, preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.alert)\n    let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: \"OK\", style: UIAlertActionStyle.cancel, handler: nil)\n    alertController.addAction(cancelAction)\n    self.view.window?.rootViewController?.present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)\n}\n\npublic func onPaymentSuccess(_ payment_id: String){\n    let alertController = UIAlertController(title: \"SUCCESS\", message: \"Payment Id \\(payment_id)\", preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.alert)\n    let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: \"OK\", style: UIAlertActionStyle.cancel, handler: nil)\n    alertController.addAction(cancelAction)\n    self.view.window?.rootViewController?.present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)\n}\n\n(void)onPaymentSuccess:(nonnull NSString*)payment_id {\n      [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Payment Successful\" message:payment_id delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@\"OK\" otherButtonTitles:nil] show];\n}\n\n(void)onPaymentError:(int)code description:(nonnull NSString *)str {\n      [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Error\" message:str delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@\"OK\" otherButtonTitles:nil] show];\n}\n\nAfter a payment is done, you have to add the necessary actions based on success/error criteria.\n\nPossible values for a failure code are:\n0: Network error\n1: Initialization failure / Unexpected behavior\n2: Payment cancelled by user\n\nSuccess handler receives a payment_id that you can use later to capture the payment.\n\niOS 9 Update\n\niOS 9 has higher requirements for secure URLs. As many Indian banks do not comply with the requirements, you can implement the following as a workaround:\n\nNSAppTransportSecurity\n\n    NSAllowsArbitraryLoads\n\nAdd the above to your info.plist file.

Razorpay can not modify this field. You can add up to 15 notes that will then be associated with the payment. For example: \"notes[internalkey1]\", \"notes[internalkey2]\"), etc. These are returned when you fetch payment details from the API.\n\nemi is available only for certain banks. To check valid banks, valid duration and EMI rates / plans to display to the user, please visit the EMI Demo page and click EMI in the payment form. You can safely cache this data at your end since this does not change without prior notification. The monthly EMI can also be cached or can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n@image ioscustomuiemi.png\n\nStep 6: Pass the WKNavigationDelegate actions to the SDK\n\nSDK handles the responses from WKWebView to give you the correct status of the payment.\n\noverride func viewDidLoad() {\n\tsuper.viewDidLoad()\n\t.\n\t.\n\tself.webView.navigationDelegate = self\n}\n\npublic func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didCommit navigation: WKNavigation!){\n\tif razorpay != nil{\n\t\tself.razorpay.webView(webView, didCommit: navigation)\n\t}\n}\n\npublic func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didFailProvisionalNavigation navigation: WKNavigation!, withError er: Error) {\n\tif razorpay != nil{\n\t\tself.razorpay.webView(webView, didFailProvisionalNavigation: navigation, withError: er)\n\t}\n}\n\npublic func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didFail navigation: WKNavigation!, withError er: Error){\n\tif razorpay != nil{\n\t\tself.razorpay.webView(webView, didFail: navigation, withError: er)\n\t}\n}\n\npublic func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didFinish navigation: WKNavigation!){\n\tif razorpay != nil{\n\t\tself.razorpay.webView(webView, didFinish: navigation)\n\t}\n}\n\noverride func viewDidLoad(){\n\tsuper.viewDidLoad();\n\t.\n\t.\n\twebView.navigationDelegate = self;\n}\n\n(void)webView:(WKWebView )webView didCommitNavigation:(WKNavigation )navigation{\n    if (razorpay){\n        [razorpay webView:webView didCommit:navigation];\n    }\n}\n\n(void)webView:(WKWebView )webView didFailProvisionalNavigation:(WKNavigation )navigation withError:(NSError *)error{\n    if (razorpay){\n        [razorpay webView:webView didFailProvisionalNavigation:navigation withError:error];\n    }\n}\n\n(void)webView:(WKWebView )webView didFailNavigation:(WKNavigation )navigation withError:(NSError *)error{\n    if (razorpay){\n        [razorpay webView:webView didFail:navigation withError:error];\n    }\n}\n\n(void)webView:(WKWebView )webView didFinishNavigation:(WKNavigation )navigation{\n    if (razorpay){\n        [razorpay webView:webView didFinish:navigation];\n    }\n}\n\nStep 7: Handle success/error when the payment is done\n\nThis is done by implementing the onPaymentSuccess and onPaymentError methods of the RazorpayPaymentCompletionProtocol.\n\nWe recommend giving the user an option to cancel the payment midway and pass on this action to us. You may also implement a retry action or display a relevant message at this step based on your use case.\n\nfunc onPaymentError(_ code: Int32, description str: String, andData response: [AnyHashable : Any]){\n\tlet alertController = UIAlertController(title: \"FAILURE\", message: str, preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.alert)\n\tlet cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: \"OK\", style: UIAlertActionStyle.cancel, handler: nil)\n\talertController.addAction(cancelAction)\n\t//self.view = view that controller manages\n\tself.view.sendSubview(toBack: self.webView)\n\tnavBar.isHidden = true\n\tnavBar.isUserInteractionEnabled = false\n\tself.view.window?.rootViewController?.present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)\n\tself.razorpay = nil\n}\n\nfunc onPaymentSuccess(_ payment_id: String, andData response: [AnyHashable : Any]){\n    let alertController = UIAlertController(title: \"SUCCESS\", message: \"Payment Id \\(payment_id)\", preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.alert)\n    let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: \"OK\", style: UIAlertActionStyle.cancel, handler: nil)\n    alertController.addAction(cancelAction)\n    //self.view = view that controller manages\n    self.view.sendSubview(toBack: self.webView)\n    navBar.isHidden = true\n    navBar.isUserInteractionEnabled = false\n    self.view.window?.rootViewController?.present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)\n    self.razorpay = nil\n}\n\n//MARK: Action functions\n@IBAction func cancel(_ sender: Any){\n\n\tlet alertController = UIAlertController(title: \"Cancel Transaction\", message: \"Are you sure you want to cancel the current transaciton ?

Additionally, the payments that are late authorized and not captured are auto-refunded in 5 days.\n\nHowever, following are few suggestions on how you can handle payments that get late authorized:\n\nCommunicate with your customer\nWhen a customer reaches out to you about a payment that was debited from her/his bank account before a successful order completion, ensure that you have clearly communicated about the status of the payment and how you will be handling it. You can choose to send out a message such as the following: “If your order has failed and the amount has been debited, the debited amount will be auto-refunded in 5 working days (without taking into account the processing time of your bank).”\n\nUnderstand your business need\nDepending upon your business needs, you can decide how to handle payments that may get late authorized. This would largely depend on whether you can provide service for the late authorized payment.\n\n    If you cannot provide service for a late authorized payment, it can be ignored. Payments that stay in Authorized state will be auto-refunded to customers within 5 working days (without taking into account bank's processing time).\nFor example, an online food ordering service needs to deliver food immediately on receiving payments. Since the need to deliver the service is immediate in this business, the merchant cannot oblige her/his customer if the payment gets authorized late. In this case, the merchant can ignore the payment made as it will be auto-refunded and communicate to the customer accordingly.\n\n    If you wish to provide the service later, there are ways in which you can keep a close track of these payments and fulfill the order when it is authorized.\nFor example, an online marketplace merchant that sells clothes and accessories, can mark the order as 'pending' in her/his system and deliver the order when the payment gets authorized.\n\n    Note: Auto-refunds are issued within 5 days. However, if you want to issue a refund instantly, you can capture the payment and issue a refund as per your requirements.\n\nUtilize recommended options\nFollowing are ways in which payments that are authorized late can be effectively managed to fulfil your customer’s order:\n\nOrder API\n\nOrder API makes it easier to handle cases of late authorization in the following ways:\n\nIt clubs multiple payment attempts against the same order. If one of the payment is successful and another attempt gets Late Authorized, the late authorized payment is refunded immediately and only successful payment is marked against the order.\n\nIt supports auto-capturing of normal payments. However, payments that are Late Authorized are not auto-captured. (This support feature can vary for different business models as auto-capturing of late authorized payments is available on request.) To enable this feature, you can get in touch with us at https://razorpay.com/support for any queries.\n\nNote: Auto-capturing can be enabled for only those payments that have been authorized within 5 days of payment creation. If the payment remains in Authorized state even after 5 days, it will get auto-refunded.\n\nAnother advantage of using Orders API is that only one successful payment is allowed against an order. In case your customer retries the payment against the same order, Order API will ensure that only one successful payment is processed against it.\n\nWebhooks\nWebhooks allow you to get notified when payments move to Authorized state. The webhook payment.authorized sends you a notification when the payment you were expecting to be Late Authorized moves to Authorized state. This allows you to send email notifications to your customers on the payment section and take further action to deliver the service. You can set up webhooks from the your Razorpay Dashboard. Go through our Webhooks documentation to know more.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs late authorization of payment specific to Razorpay?\nNo. While other gateways also face these interruptions, Razorpay ensures that our merchants have a way of handling late authorized payments via Orders API or Webhooks and track their progress on the Dashboard.\n\nWill a payment change to Authorized* if the customer's account has been debited?*\nNo. In some cases, although rare, banks automatically refund the transaction without changing the status. This can vary from bank to bank.\n","url":"late-authorization/handling_late_authorization"},{"title":"Late Authorization of Payments","desc":"Learn what late authorization is, how to handle it, causes of late authorization or what is the difference between normal payments & late authorized payments.","body":"\nWhat is Late Authorization?\n\nLate authorization is a situation that arises when a payment that is near to completion is interrupted by external factors such as network issues, technical errors at customer's/bank's end, manual intervention, and many others. In such cases, funds may get debited from the customer's bank account and Razorpay does not receive a payment status from the bank.\n\nIf there is no response from the bank, the Dashboard shows this payment attempt as Created\nfor the first 10 minutes, it is then marked as Failed due to timeout. Thereafter, Razorpay will poll the bank at various intervals for 5 days, from the day of payment creation. During\nthis time, if our system receives the payment status from the bank as Successful, the payment\nis marked as authorized like any other payment and is considered as Late authorized.\n\nThe odds of a late authorized payment\nOn an average, only less than 0.5% of the total number payments get late authorized. In cases where funds get debited from the customer's bank account and are not captured at your end, Razorpay automatically refunds the customer with the same amount. As a best practice, the payment.authorized webhook can be subscribed, which notifies when a payment gets authorized or failed.\n\nNot all payments that appear as Failed will be considered as Late authorized. Late authorization is a special case of handling technical/manual interruptions that prevent Razorpay from receiving payment status from the bank and proceed with the payment flow.\n\nWhat causes Late Authorization?\n\nInterruptions that prevent a payment gateway from receiving payment status information from the bank is a common scenario. In most cases, payments are interrupted because of any of the following reasons:\nNetwork issues at the customer's end\nTechnical issues at the customer's bank's end\nCustomers closing the pop-up window or pressing the back button after submitting the OTP.\n\nIf at a later time, Razorpay is able to receive the payment status from the bank, payment is moved to Authorized state leading to late authorization of the payment. While there is only little control on these interruptions, you can prepare to handle such situations to avoid customer inconvenience. More details on handling late authorized payments is in the section Handling Late Authorization.\n\n@image late_auth.png\n\nThe difference in the payment flow for a normal payment and a late authorized payment is explained in the table below:\n\nNormal payment\nLate authorization\n\nCustomer completes the payment, bank gateway notifies Razorpay.\nCustomer completes the payment, bank gateway fails to notify Razorpay.\n\nIf the bank gateway response is Successful (customer's bank account is debited), Razorpay records this as an Authorized payment.\nIf there is no response from the bank, the payment remains in Created state for the first 10 minutes and is then marked as Failed after getting timed out. Customer's bank account may or may not have been debited.\n\nOnce authorized, you can either choose to Capture or Refund this payment.\n\nNote: Authorized payments are payments that are completed by the customer. To record it for settlement at merchant's end, this payment has to be Captured.\n\nThis payment can be Captured or Refunded only after it is late authorized.\n","url":"late-authorization"},{"title":"Magento Plugin 1.x","body":"\nThe Razorpay Magento Plugin enables you to accept payments on your Magento e-commerce site via Razorpay Checkout form.

Instead of the bank pages, the customer is presented with a native view. This makes the payment experience more immersive and mobile friendly.\nMagic currently only works on card payments and has been tested on the following banks:\n\nAxis Bank | Citibank | HDFC | HSBC | ICICI\n\nIDBI | Indian | J&K | Kotak | RBL\n\nState Bank of India | State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur | State Bank of Hyderabad | State Bank of Mysore | State Bank of Patiala\n\nState Bank of Travancore | Standard Chartered\n\nFAQ\n1. What is the difference between the Magic plugin and the Custom UI SDK?\n\nThe Custom UI SDK lets merchants design their own user interface for collecting payment information from customers.\nThe Magic plugin is an addon for the Custom UI SDK which removes the need for the end user to interact with non-responsive bank pages in a webview. Instead of the bank pages, the customer is presented with a native view on which they can choose an authentication mode (Visa password or OTP), submit the OTP auto-read from their SMS or manually enter it. Magic only works for card payments\n\n2. Are there two separate SDKs that the merchant needs to integrate?\n\nNo. The Magic Plugin is embedded inside the Custom UI SDK and given out on a case to case basis. The standard Custom UI SDK (without the Magic plugin) is available for download from its documentation page.\n\n3. Can I disable the Magic Plugin if required? Or do I need to integrate again with the standard Custom UI SDK?\n\nNo, you do not need to switch SDKs to disable Magic. As mentioned above, the Magic Plugin is an addon and it can be disabled/enabled using a toggle method whenever required. The actual payment creation and authorization process is handled by the Custom UI SDK\n\n4. Can we use our own native layout intead of the ones provided by the SDK?\n\nThe Magic Plugin by default shows the interacation components required to autorize a payment in a Bottomsheet Dialog (See screenshots below). You can however choose to show these components in a custom defined layout.\n\n5. Can the Magic Plugin be disabled while the payment is being done? What if the end user feels more secure with interacting with a bank page?\n\nOn each and every screen in the Magic Plugin, there is a CTA which allows the end user to view the bank page. Clicking on this CTA will hide the bottomsheet and show the bank page in a webivew.\n\nScreenshots\n\n@image magic_choice.png\n@image magicotpuse.png\n@image magicotpmanual.png\n","url":"magic"},{"title":"Usage","body":"\nCustom UI SDK integration\n\nBefore you can begin with the Magic plugin integration, you need to complete the Custom UI SDK integration.

Each\nclient gets it's own clientid and clientsecret. The development client can\nbe used in your sandbox environment, or in the integration phase. The production\nclient can be used once you go live.\n\nThe differences in usage of these two clients are\nexplained below:\n\nClients\n\nThe attributes of a client are described below:\n\nClient ID\n: Publicly exposed identifier of the client, generated\nuniquely. It helps identify your application on Razorpay.\n\nClient Secret\n: Privately shared string between the application and Razorpay.\nThe client secret should never be exposed publicly. It helps to authenticate the\nidentity of the application on server-to-server API calls.\n\nRedirect URIs\n: This is a whitelisted set of URIs, defined during creation. In order to prevent\nman-in-the-middle attacks, production clients can only use secure HTTPS URIs.\n\nDevelopment and Production Usage\n\nThe usage restrictions on development and production clients are as follows:\n\nRedirect URI: Development clients can have any Redirect URI's whitelisted -\nincluding non-HTTP and localhost. Production clients cannot use non-HTTPS Redirect URIs.\n\nMode Access: Razorpay provides two modes/environments where the merchant\ncan operate - test and live. While development clients can access both modes,\nproduction clients may only access live mode data.\n\nCreating an Application\n\nThe first step towards building an OAuth integration is creating an application.\n\nNote: Only an Admin user can create applications on Razorpay dashboard.\n\nTo create an application,\n\nOn the left menu of the dashboard, go to Settings and click Applications.\nClick Create Application under the Created Applications\nsection.\nEnter the Application Name. The name provided here is displayed on Razorpay's\nauthorization interface.\nEnter the URL of the application's website under Website.\nUpload a Logo for the application. It should be a square image. If no logo is provided,\na default logo will be used.\nClick Create to create the application on Razorpay. On success, the following fields are displayed:\nClient ID and Secret (read only) for development and production clients.\nRedirect URIs which are whitelisted URIs for development and production clients.

Now, when the user wants to use Acme Corp. application, he or she\nis asked to sign in to Razorpay on the application, approve permissions allowing\nthe application to access protected resources and only then proceed with using\nthe application. This is provided via a number of requests and responses that\nare generated as a part of the OAuth model.\n\nBefore you Begin\n\nWhile the OAuth flow is fairly straightforward, you will need to have the\nfollowing ready:\n\nSignup with Razorpay. This is required for registering your application on\nRazorpay Dashboard.\nFront-end interface to connect with Razorpay. This could be a button on your\nUI that points to Razorpay's OAuth page.\nA Redirect URL pointing to your application - Razorpay will redirect users to\nthis URL.\n\nGetting Started\n\nAt a high level, the following steps are required to get started with integrating your\nthird-party application via Razorpay OAuth:\n\nCreating an Application: Register your application on Razorpay to receive\nclient credentials (clientid and clientsecret).\nAuthorization: This is the process of requesting a Razorpay merchant to\ngrant your client access.\n\nDetails on each of the steps mentioned above are provided in the following sections.\nprocess of requesting a Razorpay merchant to\ngrant your client access.\n\nDetails on each of the steps mentioned above are provided in the following sections.\n","url":"oauth"},{"title":"Testing OAuth Flow","body":"\nCreating a sample application allows you to test the entire Razorpay OAuth flow in order to securely obtain access to merchant's data. In this document, we demonstrate the integration steps by granting access to your application for your own account.\n\nCreating a Test Application\n\nTo create a test application you need to have an OAuth access on your Razorpay account. To request the OAuth feature, You can get in touch with us at https://razorpay.com/support.\n\nOnce you have obtained access, follow the instructions given below to create a test application:\n\nOn your Razorpay Dashboard, navigate to Settings > Applications.\n\nClick Create Application under the Created Applications section.\n\nEnter the Name of your application for example, \"Acme Corp\". This would appear on Razorpay's authorization page.\n\nEnter the Website URL of the application.\n\nClick Upload App Icon to upload the company's logo. This icon will also be displayed on the authorization page and on the list of connected applications on the merchant's dashboard.\n\n\tNote: The dashboard only allows square images to be uploaded as App Icon.\n\nClick Save. This will create an application on your Razorpay account and will appear in the list of created applications. An Edit Application page will show the application settings for both Development and Production clients.\n\n\tClient ID and Client Secret are predefined for both Development and Production clients. Use them to make request calls to Razorpay servers.\n\n\t@image oauthtest3.png\n\nEnter the Redirect URIs in comma-separated format.\n\tFor Production client, only URLs with https are supported, for example, https://acmecorp.com\n\nClick Save.\n\nClick Preview OAuth Page. This will redirect you to the authorization page where you can authorize or decline access to your test application for your own account. Post setup, you can request access to the merchant account/data for you application in the same manner.\n\n\t Note: For development clients, we support https://localhost as a redirect_uri on Preview. You can however replace it with any of the valid URLs as specified in the Developement client settings and reload the page.\n\nClick Authorize. This will redirect you to the redirect_uri sent in the request URL along with the auth code.\n\nCopy the auth code from the URL and use it to obtain the new access token.\n\n\t Note: While making the API request, pass mode=test. This will fetch you an access token for the test mode. Although the default is Live mode, testing with live token would not help much unless your account is activated.\n\n\tFor both production and development clients, you can control the accessibilty of the application using the scope parameter. A readwrite (scope=readwrite) access would grant edit access to the application while readonly (scope=readonly) would allow only view access.\n\nYour test application will appear in the list of Connected Applications on the merchant's Dashboard.\n\n@image oauthtest5.png\n\nRevoking Access\n\n@// Need a use case here.\n\nRevoking access to a particular application would restrict all permissions to access merchant data and thereby remove it from the list of Connected Applications.\n\nTo revoke access to a connected application, click Revoke beside the application.\n\nTesting Webhooks\n\nYou can test webhooks for specific event on your test application.\n\nTo test webhooks for your created sample application, follow the below steps:\n\nOn your Razorpay Dashboard, navigate to Settings > Applications.\n\nClick Applications.\n\nOn the Edit Application page, click Manage Webhook.\n\nGenerate a unique test endpoint for webhooks.\n\nEnter the generated URL in the Webhook URL field.

Orders API integration is done at your backend and is the first step of the payment flow.\n\nTo setup the entire Razorpay payment ecosystem, you must also integrate Checkout. Refer the Payment Gateway section to quickly get the entire payment system up and running.\n\nGetting Started\n\nIntegrating Orders API requires you to:\n\nCreate an Order\nStore fields returned by Orders API in your backend\nPass the Order ID to Razorpay Checkout\nVerify the payment\n\nCreating an Order\n\nTo create an order, there are certain attributes that you should mandatorily define. An order must always have an amount (in paise) which the customer would be charged with at the time of checkout. Currently, we only support INR as currency. You can however display the amount in any desired currency by converting it manually.\n\nIn addition to amount and currency, an order also requires a receipt whose value should be order ID created at your end. This receipt should be mapped to order_id sent by Razorpay. Refer the complete orders entity().\n\nNote: Currently We do not support currency coversions and would require you to manually handle it from your end.\n\nSample API Request\n\nThe following is a sample API request and response for creating an order:\n\ncurl -u rzptest26ccbdbfe0e84b:69b2e24411e384f91213f22a \\\n    https://api.razorpay.com/v1/orders\n    -X POST \\\n    --data \"amount=50000\" \\\n    --data \"currency=INR\" \\\n    --data \"receipt=rcptid #1\" \\\n    --data \"payment_capture=0\"\n    https://api.razorpay.com/v1/orders\n\ntry {\n  JSONObject orderRequest = new JSONObject();\n  // amount in paise\n  orderRequest.put(\"amount\", 50000);\n  orderRequest.put(\"currency\", \"INR\");\n  orderRequest.put(\"receipt\", \"orderrcptid11\");\n  orderRequest.put(\"payment_capture\", false);\n\n  Order order = razorpay.Orders.create(orderRequest);\n} catch (RazorpayException e) {\n  // Handle Exception\n  System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n}\n\norder_amount = 50000\norder_currency = 'INR'\norderreceipt = 'orderrcptid_11'\nnotes = {'Shipping address': 'Bomanahalli, Bangalore'}   # OPTIONAL\n\nclient.order.create(amount=orderamount, currency=ordercurrency, receipt=orderreceipt, notes=notes, paymentcapture='1')\n$order  = $client->order->create([\n  'receipt'         => 'orderrcptid11',\n  // amount in paise\n  'amount'          => 50000,\n  'currency'        => 'INR',\n  'payment_capture' =>  '0'\n]);\n\nDictionary options = new Dictionary();\n// amount in paise\noptions.Add(\"amount\", 50000);\noptions.add(\"receipt\", \"orderrcptid11\");\noptions.add(\"currency\", \"INR\");\noptions.add(\"payment_capture\", \"0\");\nOrder order = client.Order.Create(options);\n\noptions = amount: 50000, currency: 'INR', receipt: '', payment_capture: '0'\norder = Razorpay::Order.create\n\nvar options = {\n  // amount in paise\n  amount: 50000,\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  receipt: \"orderrcptid11\",\n  payment_capture: '0'\n};\ninstance.orders.create(options, function(err, order) {\n  console.log(order);\n});\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"order_4xbQrmEoA5WJ0G\",\n  \"entity\": \"order\",\n  \"amount\": 50000,\n  \"currency\": \"INR\",\n  \"receipt\": \"orderrcptid11\",\n  \"status\": \"created\",\n  \"attempts\": 0,\n  \"created_at\": 1455696638,\n  \"notes\": {}\n}\n\nNotes: See the complete orders entity.\n\nOnce you have captured a payment successfully, the order status will move to paidand no more payments can be made against this order.\n\nThe request parameters are explained in the following table:\n\namount required\n: Amount for the order in Paise. Payment can only be made for this amount against the order.\n\ncurrency required\n: INR is the only supported currency currently.\n\nreceipt required\n: Your receipt id for this order should be passed in here. Maximum length 40 characters.\n\npaymentcapture optional_\n: Payment capture flag for auto capturing payment. Learn about capturing payments.\n\nnotes optional\n: Object consisting of key value pairs as notes. To read more, refer Notes.\n\nNote:\nRazorpay API uses basic auth for authentication and is explained in the API reference section.\n\nFields to be Stored\n\nIn your system you will be creating a unique identifier for orders such as order_id\ntransactionid, checkoutid. For convenience, let us call this the merchantorderid. This merchantorderid corresponds to the order we create. It is created in your server and is not the order_id returned by Razorpay.\n\nYou should be storing at least the following objects from Razorpay in your database:\n\nrazorpayorderid\n: This is the orderid returned by the Razorpay's Orders API. razorpayorder_id is created at\nthe start of payment and returned once the payment is completed by the customer.\n\nrazorpaypaymentid\n: This is the paymentid returned by the Razorpay's API. razorpaypayment_id is returned only when the payment is successful.\n\nNote: Razorpay also returns a razorpay_signature along with other fields which is used for verifying the payment. Payment verification is mandatory step in a payment flow which is explained in the later section.\n\nPassing Order ID to Checkout\nOnce you have created an order, your next step is to pass the Razorpay orderid to checkout. Once the checkout process is completed, you will get back the razorpayorderid, razorpaypaymentid and razorpaysignature which you can then use to create and verify payments.\n\nTo know more about Razorpay Checkout, see the detailed Checkout documentation.\n\nCapturing Payments\n\nThe capture step enables the merchant to approve the transfer of the charged\namount towards their account. This security step does not necessarily have to\ninvolve a network request.\n\nRazorpay Orders allows us to auto-capture payments on your behalf which means, the payment\nautomatically moves to captured state after getting authorized from the bank.\nIn such cases, you do not need to make an extra network request.\n\nAlthough the payment has been auto-captured, you must verify the payment. This is serves as a security step and ensures that the\namount debited from the customer's account is same as the received amount.\n\nLearn how to enable/disable payment auto-capture using\norders API.\n\nPayment Verification\n\nVerifying payments allow you to decide if a payment should be successful or not. This is done as a security measure at your backend before the amount gets processed to your bank account.\n\nTo verify payments, you need to generate a verification signature with SHA256 algorithm and verify it against the Razorpay Signature that we return post checkout. This signature has to be created using the razorpaypaymentid, razorpayorderid and your key secret. This is a mandatory step that ensures all your authorized payments are successfully verified.\n\nRead more:\nTo know more about the Payment Verification process, refer Payment Verification.\n","url":"orders/creating"},{"title":"Orders","index":false,"body":"\nOrders API allows you to create a Razorpay orderid each time your customer completes checkout.  This unique orderid will have a 1:1 mapping with the order created at your end.\n\nIf there are multiple payment attempts made against an order, Razorpay ties all the attempts to a single order_id which can later be used to query the Razorpay system. Furthermore, it also ensures that only the payment that gets authorized is processed and any other unprocessed payment is refunded by Razorpay.\n\n Note: If you are integrating on third-party platforms such as WooCommerce, Wordpress, Magento, you need not manually integrate Orders API.

To get the razorpaysignature, you need to implement the PaymentResultWithDataListener interface to receive the razorpay_signature in the onPaymentSuccess callback.\n\npublic class MerchantActivity extends Activity implements PaymentResultWithDataListener {\n  // ...\n\n  @Override\n  public void onPaymentSuccess(String razorpayPaymentID, PaymentData data) {\n       String paymentId = data.getPaymentId();\n       String signature = data.getSignature();\n       String orderId = data.getOrderId();\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void onPaymentError(int code, String response, PaymentData data) {\n\n  }\n\nCheckout on iOS\n\nImplement RazorpayPaymentCompletionProtocolWithData:\n\n#import\n\n@interface ViewController ()  {\n  Razorpay *razorpay;\n..\n..\n}\n..\n..\n\n// Any place before initiating the payment (eg. viewDidLoad)\n(void)viewDidLoad {\n  [super viewDidLoad];\n  ..\n  ..\n  razorpay = [Razorpay initWithKey:@\"rzptest1DP5mmOlF5G5ag\"\n                       andDelegateWithData:self];\n}\n\nSuccess/Error handlers will receive a dictionary containing order_id and signature:\n\n(void)onPaymentSuccess:(nonnull NSString)payment_id andData:(nullable NSDictionary )response{\n      [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Payment Successful\" message:payment_id delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@\"OK\" otherButtonTitles:nil] show];\n}\n\n(void)onPaymentError:(int)code description:(nonnull NSString )str andData:(nullable NSDictionary )response {\n      [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Error\" message:str delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@\"OK\" otherButtonTitles:nil] show];\n}\n\nAuto-Capturing\n\nCapturing a payment is the last step of a payment process which enables the\nmerchant to approve the transfer of the charged amount towards their account.\nRazorpay will transfer the amount to the merchant's account in T+3 days, post\nwhich the payment will be refunded back to the customer. The payment moves to\ncaptured state after it has been successfully captured.\n\nIn the create order request, the parameter payment_capture is set to 1 by default, which enables auto capturing of payments.\n\nApart from paymentid, Checkout will also be returning razorpaysignature, which is a hexadecimal string with special properties. Instead of making the Capture API call, you can simply verify the signature in your backend server. If the signature is valid, the payment is successful and auto captured. The verification process is explained below.\n\nWhile razorpaysignature is passed in all cases and can also be verified in all cases, it signifies that a payment has also been captured only if you had sent paymentcapture=1.\n\nDisabling Auto Capture\n\nWhen you do not want to automatically capture payments, you can set auto_capture= 0.\nThis will enable you to manually capture payments after they move to authorized state.\nThe payment proceeds in the normal fashion after you have manually captured them. Manual capture of payments can be done from the Dashboard and via the capture API\n\nMulti-Currency Support\n\nYou can create payments with currency other than INR only for card payments. Other payment options like netbanking, wallets, emi etc. do not have support for multi-currency.\n\nBy default, Orders API only supports INR payments. However, to collect payments in other currencies, during order creation, pass the currency parameter in Order as USD or EUR.\n\nThe returned order entity will also contain the currency which you passed in for creating an order.\n\n Currency denomination: The amount is always in the lowest denomination allowed in the currency. So in case of USD, the amount provided should be in cents.\n\nA sample order entity is given below:\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"order_4xbQrmEoA5WJ0G\",\n  \"entity\": \"order\",\n  \"amount\": 500,\n  \"currency\": \"USD\",\n  \"receipt\": \"Receipt #20\",\n  \"status\": \"created\",\n  \"attempts\": 0,\n  \"created_at\": 1455696638,\n  \"notes\": {}\n}\n\nDuring payment creation, both amount and it's respective currency needs to be passed.\nOnce a payment is successful, you can get corresponding conversion rate and fees charged by fetching the information from the following url:\nhttps://api.razorpay.com/v1/payments/{payment_id}/transaction\n\nThe response will have the corresponding amount in INR after conversion and the total fees charged inclusive of GST.\n\nIt will also have the information as to whether the payment is settled or not via the settled column. If the settled value is true, it indicates that the payment has already been completed, else it is in pending state.\n\nNote: In addition to the orders API, we also have APIs for performing other operations such as, fetching an order, getting payment id of an order and many other. Refer to the API reference for Orders to learn how to utilize these APIs.\n\nAdding Notes\n\nNotes provides a key-value store present with Razorpay order. You can use this for storing additional data along with the Razorpay order in structured format which will be appear in the Orders API response. For example, for payments, you can store the name, customer ID, billing or shipping address. Notes is not used by Razorpay for any operational purpose. It can have a maximum of 15 keys with values up to maximum 256 characters long.\n\nAdditionally, you can\nadd custom notes which can be used internally for saving details such as merchant\nbilling and shipping address.\n","url":"orders/related"},{"title":"Supported Banks","body":"List of Banks\nUPI Third Party Validation is applicable for 101 Banks and Netbanking Third Party Validation is applicable for 14 Banks mentioned below:\n\nNote:\nAs support for more banks are added, this list will be updated.\n\nBank Codes | Bank Names | UPI Enabled | Netbanking Enabled\n\nANDB | Andhra Bank | Yes | Yes\n\nUTIB | Axis Bank | Yes | Yes\n\nFDRL | Federal Bank | Yes | Yes\n\nHDFC | HDFC Bank | Yes | Yes\n\nICIC | ICICI Bank | Yes | Yes\n\nIBKL | IDBI Bank | Yes | Yes\n\nCIUB | City Union Bank | Yes | Yes\n\nINDB | IndusInd Bank | Yes | Yes\n\nSBIN | State Bank Of India | Yes | Yes\n\nKVBL | Karur Vysaya Bank | Yes | Yes\n\nKKBK | Kotak Mahindra Bank | Yes | Yes\n\nRATN | The Ratnakar Bank Limited | Yes | Yes\n\nCORP | Corporation Bank | Yes | Yes\n\nLAVB | The Lakshmi Vilas Bank Limited | Yes |  Yes\n\nIDIB | Indian Bank | Yes |\n\nIDFB | IDFC Bank | Yes |\n\nBKID | Bank Of India | Yes |\n\nMAHB | Bank of Maharashtra | Yes |\n\nCNRB | Canara Bank | Yes |\n\nCSBK | Catholic Syrian Bank | Yes |\n\nCBIN | Centralﾠ Bank of india | Yes |\n\nDCBL | DCB Bank | Yes |\n\nBKDN | Dena Bank | Yes |\n\nIOBA | Indian Overseas Bank | Yes |\n\nJAKA | Jammu & Kashmir Bank | Yes |\n\nPSIB | Punjab and Sind | Yes |\n\nSIBL | South Indian Bank | Yes |\n\nSCBL | Standard Chartered | Yes |\n\nKARB | Karnataka Bank | Yes |\n\nORBC | Oriental Bank of Commerce | Yes |\n\nPMCB | Punjab and Maharastra Co.

It works in conjunction with Orders API that gets called whenever an order is created.\n\nFor mobile apps (android/iOS), and Cordova/Phonegap/Ionic integrations, check out our Integrations page.\n\nWe support the following checkout methods:\n\nAutomatic Checkout\nManual Checkout\n\nNote: Before you start using the checkout.js, include ` in the ` section of your page, in order to correctly render the checkout form.\n\nAutomatic Checkout\n\nTo integrate automatic checkout, you simply have to use the sample code given below anywhere in your website to make the default Razorpay button appear. When clicked, the button invokes the checkout form.\n\nThe form options are passed as data attributes inside a ` tag. Once the payment is successfully authorized, a response object containing razorpaypaymentid, razorpayorderid and razorpay_signature` gets auto-submitted to a URL that you set in the form action.\n\nThis response object can be utilized to verify the Razorpay signature and to capture the payment.\n\nGiven below is a sample code that will pass the form options as HTML data-attributes:\n\nNote: The amount must always be in paisa. In the above example, an amount  of @data.Rs 235 is specified in paise as amount 23500.\n\nManual Checkout\n\nIn manual checkout method, you have the complete control over how and when you wish to invoke the checkout form on your site. The checkout has to be opened using a JavaScript function. The form options are passed as variables in a key-value pair format.\n\nOnce the payment is successfully authorized, the handler function (written by you) is called. You have to write this function such that the feilds such as razorpaypaymentid, razorpayorderidand razorpay_signature passed by Razorpay is then passed to your server to complete the payment verification\n\nThe sample code below will pass the form options for an amount of @data.Rs 200:\n\nPay\n\n/**\n    This is the options variable through which\n    you can pass various parameters to Razorpay Checkout.\n    */\n\n    var options = {\n        \"key\": \"rzptest32hsbEKriO6ai4\",\n        \"amount\": \"20000\", // INR 200\n        \"name\": \"Acme Corp\",\n        \"description\": \"A Wild Sheep Chase is the third novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami\",\n        \"image\": \"https://example.com/your_logo\",\n        \"handler\": function (response){\n            alert(response.razorpaypaymentid);\n        },\n        \"prefill\": {\n            \"name\": \"Gaurav Kumar\",\n            \"email\": \"gaurav.kumar@razorpay.com\"\n        },\n        \"notes\": {\n            \"address\": \"note value\"\n        },\n        \"theme\": {\n            \"color\": \"#F37254\"\n        }\n    };\n\n/**\n    This is how you pass the options\n    and create a new Razorpay instance.\n    */\n\nvar rzp1 = new Razorpay(options);\n\n/**\n    This is the sample for code how\n    you wish to open the Razorpay Checkout\n    based on the user button click.\n    */\ndocument.getElementById('rzp-button1').onclick = function(e){\n    rzp1.open();\n    e.preventDefault();\n}\n\nNote: The open method of Razorpay object (rzp1.open()) must be invoked by your site's JavaScript, on a user-driven action, such as a click.\n\nHow to Switch between Methods\n\nWhile switching from manual to automatic checkout requires integration changes, we provide you the option to change, if need be. This is possible as our checkout.js searches for the data-key field inside the ` tag which when found, the script switches to automatic mode. It also creates a button alongside the  tag and attaches its onclick event handler (created internally) to the .open` method of the Razorpay object.\n\nRead more:\nFor detailed reference on checkout form, refer the Checkout documentation.\n","url":"payment-gateway/checkout"},{"title":"Payment Gateway","index":false,"body":"Getting Started\n\nBuild a secure payment solution on your website or mobile app with Razorpay and receive payments from your customers from various payment modes. You can track payments at every step of its lifecycle and effectively manage them.\n\nBefore you start the integration process, there are few things you should go through, like the payment flow, different payment statuses used by Razorpay etc.\n\nAll core payment operations such as payment creation, authorization, capturing, refund, can be performed via our APIs. You can also perform some of these operations through the Razorpay Dashboard as well.\n\nPayment Flow\n\nThe process of accepting payments from your end customers is as follows:\nCustomer selects an item on your ecommerce site/app and proceeds to Checkout.\nAn order is created in your system corresponding to the payment that is initiated.\nCustomer clicks on the Pay button and is shown the Checkout Form.\nCustomer fills in the payment details and authorizes the payment.\nYou get the money in your bank account as per your settlement schedule.\n\nPoints to Note: The amount that is passed must always be in paisa. For example, an amount  of @data.Rs 561 is specified in paise as amount 56100.\n\nPayment States\nWhen you accept payments with Razorpay, it goes through a number of logical states in one payment cycle. In a standard payment flow, a payment goes through the following states:\n\ncreated\n: Payment is created when a user (the customer) fills up and submits the payment information and it is sent to the Razorpay API. No processing has been done on the payment at this stage.\n\nauthorized\n: An authorization is performed when user’s payment details are successfully authenticated by the bank. The money is deducted from the customer’s account, but will not be transferred to the merchant’s account until it is explicitly captured by merchant.\n\ncaptured\n: The next step, called capture, verifies the purchase as complete by the merchant. After capture, the amount is transferred to the merchant as per the settlement schedule. The captured amount must be same as authorized amount.\nAny authorization not followed by a capture within 5 days is automatically voided and refunded.\n\nrefunded\n: A successfully captured payment can be refunded by the merchant.\nThe first two steps (Creation and Authorization) are handled by the checkout form and are client sided. The next two steps (Capture and Refund) are handled using the API and are server side requests.\n\nIntegrating Razorpay\nBased on your requirement you can either select from a list of available options for third party integrations or you can build your own integration.\n\nThere are two aspects to building your own integration:\nBackend side integration (Orders API)\nFrontend side integration (Razorpay Checkout) for web or mobile\n\nThe server side integration is for initiating a payment and then verifying the payment at the end of the process. The mobile integration is required for getting the customer to select a payment mode and complete the two-factor authentication process. You can use our ready to use libraries for both these types of integrations.\n\nFollowing sections explain the process in a more details:\n\nGenerate API keys\nThe API keys is required for integration with Razorpay. It is a combination of Key ID and Key Secret. You need to generate the API keys from the Razorpay Dashboard, download it and save them securely. We do not store your Key Secret. In case you lose the Key Secret, you need to regenerate it from the Dashboard and update your integration with the new keys. To generate your API keys:\n\nLog into your Dashboard.\nGo to Settings.\nSelect API Keys tab.\nClick Generate API Keys.\n\nAuthentication Mechanism\n\nAll server side requests like capture, refund, getting details of previous payment must be authenticated with basic auth using the key-id as username and key-secret as password.\n\nSend the requests to https://:@api.razorpay.com\ne.g. https://rzptestAd93zqidD9eZwy:69b2e24411e384f91213f22a@api.razorpay.com/v1/payments\n\n Note: Your Key-Secret is like your password. Never use it for client side requests and never share it with anyone.\n\nIntegrate Orders API\nFor backend integration, Razorpay provides Orders API. This API allows you to create an order when a payment is expected from a customer. An order will have a 1:1 mapping with an order on your end. This means that if a customer makes multiple payment attempts, they will be linked to the same order. You can create an order via the Orders API. The following are reasons why using Orders API is recommended:\n\nOrders API restricts successful payments to 1 per order.\nIt combines all the attempts made for an order, making it easier to query Razorpay system for an order.\nIt gives you the flexibility to disable auto-capture of payments if your business wishes to capture payments manually.\nThe order_ID returned is used to create a unique signature that will help you verify payments.\n\nFurthermore, you can easily handle cases of Late Authorization with orders.\n\nTo learn more about Orders API, click here.\n\nIntegrate Checkout\nYou can integrate Razorpay Checkout in your front end application using manual or automatic checkout option. In manual checkout, you can display the Checkout form on your site/app with all the supported modes of payment. In automatic checkout, the checkout form is auto-submitted and the customer is allowed to enter payment details via your custom UI. In both the cases, the customer is redirected back to your site once the payment is completed.\n\nTo learn more about Checkout, click here.\n\nVerify Payments in the Backend\nAs an added security measure, we enable you to verify payments at your backend using a unique signature verification method. You need to generate a verification signature with SHA256 algorithm and verify it against the Razorpay Signature that we return post checkout.\n\nThis signature has to be created using the Razorpay payment ID, Order ID and your key secret.\n\nSignature verification is a step that ensures all your authorized payments are successfully verified for fraud check before you can capture it.\n\nTo learn more about Signature Verification, click here.\n\nWebhooks\nAt every payment event, you can enable webhooks to receive alerts. Webhooks are especially useful when you want to know when a payment moves to authorized state, meaning when your customer successfully completes a payment. We offer a host of webhooks that get triggered at various events such as payment completion, captured, or when a payment fails and so on. The webhooks can be easily added from the Razorpay Dashboard or can be enabled via the API.\n\nTo learn more about Webhooks, click here.\n","url":"payment-gateway/getting-started"},{"title":"Payment Gateway","index":false,"body":"\nBuild a secure payment solution on your website or mobile app with Razorpay and receive payments from your customers through different payment modes.

This orderid needs to be passed to checkout and the same orderid is used for multiple payments attempts, if multiple payments are attempted for the same order.\n\nNote: The order_id should be stored in your database and should be fetched during payment verification.\n\nThe endpoint given below creates an order:\n\n/orders\n\nBelow are sample requests for creating an order:\n\ncurl -u rzptest26ccbdbfe0e84b:69b2e24411e384f91213f22a \\\n    https://api.razorpay.com/v1/orders\n    -X POST \\\n    --data \"amount=50000\" \\\n    --data \"currency=INR\" \\\n    --data \"receipt=Receipt #20\" \\\n    --data \"payment_capture=1\"\n    https://api.razorpay.com/v1/orders\n\ntry {\n  JSONObject orderRequest = new JSONObject();\n  // amount in paise\n  orderRequest.put(\"amount\", amount);\n  orderRequest.put(\"currency\", \"INR\");\n  orderRequest.put(\"receipt\", \"test_1\");\n  orderRequest.put(\"payment_capture\", true);\n\n  Order order = razorpay.Orders.create(orderRequest);\n} catch (RazorpayException e) {\n  // Handle Exception\n  System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n}\n\norder_amount =\norder_currency = 'INR'\norder_receipt = ''\nnotes = {'key': 'value'}   # OPTIONAL\n\nclient.order.create(amount=orderamount, currency=ordercurrency, receipt=orderreceipt, notes=notes, paymentcapture='1')\n$order  = $client->order->create([\n  'receipt'         => '',\n  // amount in paise\n  'amount'          => 100,\n  'currency'        => 'INR',\n  'payment_capture' =>  '1'\n]);\n\nDictionary options = new Dictionary();\n// amount in paise\noptions.Add(\"amount\", 100);\noptions.add(\"receipt\", \"', payment_capture: '1'\norder = Razorpay::Order.create\n\nvar options = {\n  // amount in pase\n  amount: 100,\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  receipt: \"\",\n  payment_capture: '1'\n};\ninstance.orders.create(options, function(err, order) {\n  console.log(order);\n});\nThe response is an orders entity.\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"order_4xbQrmEoA5WJ0G\",\n  \"entity\": \"order\",\n  \"amount\": 50000,\n  \"currency\": \"INR\",\n  \"receipt\": \"Receipt #20\",\n  \"status\": \"created\",\n  \"attempts\": 0,\n  \"created_at\": 1455696638,\n  \"notes\": {}\n}\n\nDisabling Auto-Capture\n\nIn the create order request, the parameter payment_capture is set to 1 by default, which enables auto capturing of payments.\n\nWhen you do not want to automatically capture payments, you can set auto_capture= 0.\nThis will enable you to manually capture payments after they move to authorized state. You can also manually capture payments using the Dashboard.\n\nRead more:\nTo know more about Orders API, refer Orders API section.\n\nPayment Verification\n\nVerifying payments allow you to decide if a payment should be successful or not. This is done as a security measure at your backend before the amount gets processed to your bank account.\n\nTo verify payments, you need to generate a verification signature with SHA256 algorithm and verify it against the Razorpay Signature that we return post checkout. This signature has to be created using the razorpaypaymentid, razorpayorderid and your key secret. This is a mandatory step that ensures all your authorized payments are successfully verified.\n\nRead more:\nTo know more about the Payment Verification process, refer Payment Verification.\n","url":"payment-gateway/orders"},{"title":"Related Information","index":false,"body":"\nRefunds API\n\nYou can initiate a refund of a payment made by your customer using Refunds API.\nRefund is done only after a payment has been successfully captured.

Especially for businesses that accepts majority of their payment through Payment Links and have issuing them as a part of their process.\n\nUploading a single file (often called the batch file) containing the required details for a collection of orders allows us to generate and process the Payment Links in bulk instead of creating individual links.\n\nBatch File Format\n\nA batch file is a simple .xlsx or .csv file that contains all the neccesary details for creating payment links for a list of Reciept Nos. The required fields for creating a batch file are explained in the table below:\n\nFields\nDescription\n\nInvoice No.\nUnique receipt ID associated with the order created at your backend. This field has a limit of 40 characters.\n\nCustomer Name\nName of the customer.\n\nCustomer Email\nEmail address of the customer.\n\nCustomer Contact\nContact number of the customer.\n\nAmount (In Paise)\nOrder amount.

This indicates that the uploaded batch is created in Razorpay's database and is ready to be processed. No processing of payment details has been done until this point.\n\nProcessed\nThis is the final state of a batch where payment details are processed and the corresponding Payment Links are ready to be issued.\n\nCreating a Batch File\n\nFollow the steps given below to upload a batch file:\n\nLog in to your Razorpay Dashboard and navigate to Payment Links > Batch Uploads.\n\nClick Start Uploading or Click here to Upload. This will open a popup window where you can either drag-drop the file over the highlighted area or click the Click to Upload option to select your file from your system.The file is validated and uploaded to Razorpay's server. Once the file is successfully uploaded, a snippet view of the file will be displayed.Learn how to handling upload errors.\n\n\t@image bu_1.png\n\n\tNote: Click  Download Sample File to refer a sample batch file.\n\nOn a popup window, name the file under the CREATE BATCH FILE NAME field.\n\nUnder the SEND PAYMENT LINKS field, select the medium (Send SMS or Send Email) through which you wish to send the Payment Links to your customers, once the batch is created.\n\n\t@image bu_2.png\n\nClick Create & Send Payment Links. This will enable Razorpay to process and issue Payment Links to their respective recipients as per the batch file. The newly created batch file will appear on the batch listing page where you can view the details of the previously created batches.\n\n\t@image bu_3.png\n\n\tSending Links Manually:\n\tIf you wish to issue the Payment Links on a later date, you can skip this step and click Create Payment Links. This will enable us to process the links but restricts us from issuing them right after they are created. The file will appear on the batch listing page where a Send all links button under Actions will let you manually issue all the links in the batch.\n\nThe details of a batch are described by the following fields:\n\nBatch Fields\nDescription\n\nBatch ID\nUnique identifier of a batch.\n\nBatch Name\nName of the batch file.\n\nCount\nThe number of processed rows in a batch.\n\nStatus\nCurrent state of the batch file.\n\nActions\nThe available actions you can take on a particular batch file: Download Report File, Send all links.\n\nThe details of a particular batch can be viewed by clicking the Batch ID. You can view the Total rows processed, Payment Links Created, Paid and Expired Links. You can also view the Status and Created At information of the batch. The details of individual Payment Links created from the batch are also displayed here.\n\nHandling Errors\n\nErrors can occur either at the time of upload or after the file reaches the Processed state.

You can integrate eCOD with all payment methods including UPI and link based payments.","body":"\nWhat is eCOD?\neCOD is a solution that allows your delivery executives to accept digital payments instead of cash.\n\nHow to integrate eCOD\nThe prerequisites for integrating eCOD are given below:\n\nMerchant must have an app for delivery executives.\nDelivery executives should have internet access on their device.\neCOD is available as an Android SDK that can be embedded in the delivery app of the merchant. The SDK handles the entire user interface for collecting payments through the various payment modes.\n\nSupported Payment Methods\neCOD allows all payment modes: card, netbanking, wallets and UPI. These modes can be divided into two categories:\n\nOn Delivery App Methods\nThe customer need not open any link.\n\nLink Based Methods\nThe customer can use these payments modes on their own device only, through a special link.\n\nOn Delivery App Methods\nThese include:\n\nWallets\nUPI\nWallet Payments\nFor wallet payments, if a customer has enough balance in the wallet, the payment can be made through just an OTP.\n\nThe flow is explained below:\n\nDelivery executive shows the wallet list to the customer on their own phone.\nCustomer selects a wallet and enters their phone number.\nCustomer receives an SMS from the wallet provider.\nCustomer inputs the OTP on the delivery executive’s phone.\nPayment is complete!\n\n No Internet Connectivity Required: This payment method does not require internet\non the customer’s side.\n\nUPI Payments\nUPI payments work through Collect request. Here’s the flow for it:\n\nDelivery executive selects UPI on their phone.\nCustomer provides their VPA (Virtual payment address).\nCustomer receives a collect request on their own phone that has been configured for UPI.\nCustomer approves the collect request using MPIN.\nPayment is complete!\n\n UPI requires Internet Connectivity: This payment method requires the customer to have VPA configured and working internet as UPI doesn’t work without internet.\n\nLink Based Methods\nLink based methods include:\n\nDebit/Credit Cards\nNetbanking\nWallets\nUPI\n\nWhile Wallets and UPI based payments can also be made through the delivery executive’s device, card and netbanking methods are only available via a special link.\n\nThe flow for link based payment is as follows:\n\nCustomer notifies the delivery executive that they want to make a payment on their own device.\nDelivery executive selects Link Payments on their device.\nCustomer receives an SMS with a link. This link is a short link and is also visible on the delivery executive’s device in text as well as QR format.\nCustomer opens the link on a computer or mobile.\nThe standard Razorpay Checkout form opens up through which customer can pay using Card, Netbanking etc.\nOnce the payment is complete, the delivery executive’s phone automatically receives notification on this.\n\n Razorpay SDK Includes the UI: In all of the above payment methods, link based as well as delivery device, the delivery executive is interacting with a UI developed by Razorpay. This will drastically reduce the integration time.\n\nIntegration Process\neCOD runs on top of Razorpay’s Invoices system. An eCOD payment is basically made against an invoice. This requires only two steps of integration:\n\nCreate an Invoice on your server\nPass the invoice_id to Razorpay’s Android SDK\n\nThat’s it! Razorpay’s Android SDK handles everything else. The overall flow is explained below:\n\nDelivery executive selects an order in the merchant’s app.\nDelivery executive clicks on Initiate Payment.\nThe merchant app makes a request to merchant server.\nMerchant server calls the create invoice request on Razorpay’s API.\nRazorpay’s API returns an invoice_id. This is passed on to the merchant app by the merchant server.\nMerchant app invokes Razorpay’s Android SDK and passes the invoice_id.\nRazorpay’s SDK displays a UI for selecting payment mode.\nCustomer selects a payment mode.\nOnce the payment is completed, Razorpay’s Android SDK passes back the control to merchant app with the result, success or failure.\n\nCreating an Invoice (server side)\n\nStep 4 described above involves creating an Invoice through Razorpay’s API. All you need for creating an invoice is the amount and the contact number of the customer.\n\nThe API details are covered in depth in the document on invoices available here.\n\nMandatory Fields for eCOD\n\nFor eCOD, you need to pass the following fields mandatorily in the create invoice API:\n\ntype: ecod\nview_less: 1\nWithout these fields, there's no guarantee of the functionality working as described.\n\nOnce this step is completed, you will have an invoice_id. This needs to be passed to merchant's mobile application.\n\nInvoking Razorpay's Android SDK\nStep 6 involves invoking Razorpay's Android SDK. The standard documentation for integration the android SDK apply here too and is available here. You can use the latest SDK available.\n\nIn the JSONO bject options that you will pass to the SDK, you need to necessarily pass the following fields:\n\ninvoice_id:\necod: true\n\nWithout these parameters, the eCOD checkout form will not be shown.\n\nCompleting the Payment\nThe delivery executive and the customer need to interact with the special eCOD checkout form displayed by the SDK. The customer has various options for completing the payment. In all the cases, once the payment is completed, the android SDK will call merchant's onPaymentSuccess method and pass over the payment_id.\n\nHandling Link Based Payment\nIf the customer chooses link based payment, an SMS is automatically sent to the customer's phone. The customer can open this link on their phone or computer. Once the payment is completed on their device, the SDK will automatically detect that the payment has been completed and call merchant's onPaymentSuccess method.\n\nSupport\n\nIf you face any issue while integrating eCOD, please write to us at integrations@razorpay.com.\n","url":"payment-links/ecod"},{"title":"ePOS","desc":"Razorpay ePOS allows you to collect payment on the app by entering details on the app itself. You can also use ePOS with SDK integration or intent flow.","body":"\nWhat is ePOS?\n\nRazorpay provides an ePOS app which is available on the\nGoogle Play Store.\nThrough this app, you can collect payments by entering\nthe details on the app itself. However, for advanced use cases\nwe offer two options:\n\nSDK integration\nIntent Flow\n\nSDK Integration\nIf you want to build complex use cases on top of eCOD/ePOS offering of Razorpay,\nyou can use our SDK. The SDK handles the UI aspects of the payment while\nyou can control the flow around creation of payments. The documentation for eCOD\nis available here.\n\nIn the SDK integration, you will need to handle the invoice generation at your end.\nIf you are looking for a simpler approach, you can use the intent flow discussed in\nbelow section.\n\nIntent Flow\nIn the intent flow, you can have your own app that has the details for the\npayment/order. The executive from your team can then select an order in your\napp and invoke the payment process.\n\nYour app can pass all the necessary details for creating an invoice through an\nintent to Razorpay ePOS app which then automatically handles the invoice creation\nas well as the payment process. Once the payment is complete, your app will get\nthe result as well.\n\nPrerequisites\nFollowing are the prerequisites for integrating the intent flow:\n\nYour executive will need to have two apps installed, one is your app which will\nfire the intent and the second is Razorpay ePOS\nThe executive should be logged in to the Razorpay ePOS app with a specific [team\nrole](../epos/#role-for-razorpay-epos).\nAt the time of the payment, the executive's phone should have internet access.\n\nRole for Razorpay ePOS\nThe executives from your team who will be collecting payments will need to have an\naccount with Razorpay and mapped to your Dashboard account. However, you may not want\nto provide them with full dashboard access. Hence, we have created a specific role for\nthis.\n\nIn your dashboard, go to Team in the left navigation. Now add the executive's email ID\nwith the role set to Delivery Executive or ePOS, whichever is available. This user\nwill now receive an email for activating the account and setting a password. This\nemail ID and password can be used in the Razorpay ePOS app.\n\nStarting the intent flow\n\nTo launch Razorpay ePOS using the intent flow you need to launch an intent with the\nfollwing URI data:\n\nrzp://epos/pay?productname=tshirt&amount=100&contact=9876543210&description=tshirt&merchantorderid=txn123qwe\n\nA helper class called RazorpayInvoice is added below which helps in creating\nthis URI. Using this class, you can generate URI as follows:\n\n/**\n Amount, product name and contact are mandatory fields\n Amount should be pass in paise as a long\n */\n RazorpayInvoice invoice = new RazorpayInvoice.Builder()\n                .setMerchantOrderId(merchantOrderId.getText().toString())\n                .setAmount(Long.parseLong(amountEt.getText().toString()))\n                .setContact(contactEt.getText().toString())\n                .setDescription(descriptionEt.getText().toString())\n                .setProductName(productNameEt.getText().toString())\n                .create();\n\ninvoice.launch(activityContext);\n\nProcessing the result\n\nTo proccess the result of a transaction you need to override the onActivityResult method and call RazorpayInvoice.handleActivityResult.\n\n@Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n        /**\n         You need to call this function in the onActivityResult method\n         */\n        RazorpayInvoice.handleOnActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data, new

The first two payments would trigger invoice.partially_paid event as payment link status continues to be that. The 3rd (last) payment would trigger invoice.paid event.\n\nCustomer-side Interaction\n\nWhen the customer opens the payment link page, if partial payment is enabled, customer will have the option to modify the payment amount to anything between 1 and the amount due at the time.\n\nYou can also view the payment history as shown below:\n","url":"payment-links/partial-payments"},{"title":"Features","index":false,"body":"\nEach and every component of a payment page is fully customizable to suit your business needs.\n\nPayment Collection Method\n\nPayment Pages mainly pivots around how you collect payments from your customers.

Batch","index":false,"body":"\nIntroduction\n\nLinked accounts can be created via Razorpay Dashboard. Visit Dashboard > Route > Accounts for the same.\n\nIn some cases it is needed that one has to create linked accounts in large numbers. For those cases we provide a flow.\n\nSteps\n\nCreate a CSV file containing rows with linked account's data. Below provided is the file format and needed data per row.\nRaise a request to process the file on the support page as an existing customer. Also share Razorpay merchant Id in email body.\nOne we process the file on our side, we will share the same file with you with a few new column appended per row. For every row, first column will have success or failure values. If success, the 2nd column will have Razorpay's account Id (newly created linked account). If failure, subsequent columns will have error description. You may then use these account Ids for various operations. Also these would be available in your Dashboard as well.\n\nHandling error-ed rows\n\nYou are requested to create a new file using error-ed rows from above shared processed file and fix the errors as per description. Also please remove the extra error columns and then share the same file with us again.\n\nIn case you find that some linked account has been created with incorrect bank account details, please create a file with corrected values and provide Razorpay's account Id in last column of the row (as described below). We will patch the existing linked account with new bank account details.\n\nFile format and data constraints\n\nProvided file must be a valid CSV with no heading values.\nEvery row should contain values per linked account in order and described as following:\n\nField | Description | Type & Validation\n\nbusiness_name | Name of the vendor | string, Max length - 255\n\nbankaccounttype | Type of account (savings/current) | string (alphabets and spaces), Max length - 20\n\nbankaccountname | Bank account name | string (alphanumeric and spaces), Max length - 120\n\nbankbranchifsc | Bank IFSC | string (alphanumeric), Length - 11 characters\n\nbankaccountnumber | Account number | string (alphanumeric), Min length - 5, Max Length - 20\n\nreference_id | Identifier for the account on your systems (We don't store this reference) | string, Max length - 255\n\naccount_id | Razorpay's account id for newly created linked account (This should be empty in provided file) | string, Length - 18\n\nSo a few sample row in the file would look like following:\n\nABC Corp,current,ABC Crop Bank Account Name,HDFC0000060,12345678910121,INTERNAL_REF,\nXYZ Corp,current,XYZ Crop Bank Account Name,HDFC0000060,12345678910121,INTERNAL_REF,\n\nYou can get in touch with us at https://razorpay.com/support for any queries.\n","url":"private/batch-linked-accounts"},{"title":"Native OTP","index":false,"body":"Introduction\nRazorpay's payment gateway supports one-time passwords (OTPs) in the checkout form itself without the customers being redirected to the ACS page of their respective issuing banks. By implementing Native OTP feature, you can extend a simple and efficient OTP flow to your customers, reduce payment failures due to low internet speeds, and avoid failures due to redirects to bank pages.\n\nPrerequisites\nBefore implementing the Native OTP feature, check if the following requirements are in place:\nVerify that you are PCI compliant to accept and process customer's card details.\n   Learn more about the PCI compliance. The compliance certificate should be updated as per the yearly renewal cycle.\nRaise a request with Razorpay Support to enable the support for this feature in your Checkout page.\nFamiliarize yourselves with the payment process, refer the payment flow\n\nCreating the Workflow for Native OTP\n\nCreating a Razorpay order\nValidating authentication type\nCreating a payment\nOTP Authentication\nPayment Verification\n\nAPI Authentication: Razorpay APIs are authenticated  using Basic Auth method where your keyid is the Username and keysecret is the Password. You can access your account keys from the Dashboard. Learn more about API authentication.\n\n1. Create a Razorpay Order\n\nA Razorpay Order creates an order ID that corresponds to the unique order(transaction ID or checkout ID) created at your end. The Order ID is tied to all the payments made against that particular order.\n\n/orders\n\ncurl -XPOST \\\n'https://api.razorpay.com/v1/orders' \\\n-u : \\\n-d 'amount=50000' \\ #Amount in Paise\n-d 'currency=INR' \\\n-d 'receipt=BILL13375649' \\\n-d 'payment_capture=1'\n{\n  JSONObject orderRequest = new JSONObject();\n  orderRequest.put(\"amount\", 50000); //Amount in Paise\n  orderRequest.put(\"currency\", \"INR\");\n  orderRequest.put(\"receipt\", \"BILL13375649\");\n  orderRequest.put(\"payment_capture\", true);\n  Order order = razorpay.Orders.create(orderRequest)\n}\ncatch (RazorpayException e) //Handle Exception\n\n{\n  System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n}\norder_amount = 50000\norder_currency = 'INR'\norder_receipt = 'BILL13375649'\nnotes = {'details': 'A Wild Sheep Chase by Haruki Murakami'} # Optional\nclient.order.create(amount=50000, currency=INR, receipt=BILL13375649, notes=A Wild Sheep Chase, payment_capture='1')\n$order  = $client->order->create([\n  'receipt'         => 'BILL13375649',\n  'amount'          => 50000, // Amount in Paise\n  'currency'        => 'INR',\n  'payment_capture' =>  '1'\n]);\nDictionary options = new Dictionary();\noptions.Add(\"amount\", 50000); // Amount in Paise\noptions.add(\"receipt\", \"BILL13375649\");\noptions.add(\"currency\", \"INR\");\noptions.add(\"payment_capture\", \"1\");\nOrder order = client.Order.Create(options);\noptions = amount: 50000, currency: 'INR', receipt: 'BILL13375649', payment_capture: '1'\norder = Razorpay::Order.create\nvar options = {\n  amount: 50000, // Amount in Paise\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  receipt: \"BILL13375649\",\n  payment_capture: '1'\n};\ninstance.orders.create(options, function(err, order) {\n  console.log(order);\n});\n{\n  \"id\": \"order_9A33XWu170gUtm\",\n  \"entity\": \"order\",\n  \"amount\": 50000,\n  \"currency\": \"INR\",\n  \"receipt\": \"BILL13375649\",\n  \"status\": \"created\",\n  \"attempts\": 0,\n  \"created_at\": 1455696638,\n  \"notes\": {}\n}\n\nLearn more about Razorpay Orders.\n\n2. Validate Authentication Type\nValidating the authentication type is critical. This will help you set the value of authtype in payment creation. If the value of authtype is sent as otp for a BIN which is not validated successfully, the transaction will fail.\n\nThe following API endpoint will enable Razorpay to verify the OTP-based authentication flow for a specific card:\n\n/payment/flows\n\ncurl -XPOST \\\n'https://api.razorpay.com/v1/payment/flows' \\\n-u : \\\n-d 'card_number=4242424242424242'\n{\n  \"otp\": true,\n  \"pin\": true/false\n}\n\n{\n  []\n}\n\n3. Create a Payment\n\nAfter the Order ID is created, create a payment for the Order ID. The API endpoint for creating a payment is given below:\n\n/payments/create/redirect\n\nRequest Parameters\n\ncurrency string\n: The currency of the payment amount. Pass INR for Indian rupees as currently we do not support foreign currencies.\n\namount integer\n: The payment amount in Paise. For example, for @data.Rs 195.55, pass 19555.\n\norderid string_\n: The unique identifier of the order created using Razorpay Orders API.

OTP Authentication\n\nAfter entering the OTP, the customer can perform either of the two actions, as described in the next parameter:\n\nOTP Submit\nOTP Resend\n\nnext array\n: This array specifies the available actions as a comma-separated list. It can have the following predefined values: -otpsubmit-otpresend. In cases where two-factor authentication is not required or not available, the next object will not be returned in the response.\n\n[next]otpsubmit string_\n: This value is consumed to display otp submit option.\n\n[next]otpresend string_\n: This value is consumed as a retry option for OTP submission. If the parameter is not present, the OTP resend option cannot be shown to the customers. The resend option may be unavailable after certain number of retries. The number of retries is determined by the bank and not by Razorpay.\n\nOTP Submit\n\nOTP submission is a part of payment authentication process from the customer's end where a 6-digit OTP received is submitted through your application's frontend.\n\n@// Is this still valid?\n\nFor card payments, customer receives the OTP via their preferred notification medium - SMS, email. The OTP received must be submitted to the following endpoint:\n\npayments/:id/otp/submit\n\ncurl -XPOST \\\n'https://api.razorpay.com/v1/payments/pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f/otp/submit' \\\n-u : \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\n-d 'otp=123456'\n{\n  \"razorpaypaymentid\": \"pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f\",\n  \"razorpayorderid\": \"order_9A33XWu170gUtm\",\n  \"razorpay_signature\": \"9ef4dffbfd84f1318f6739a3ce19f9d85851857ae648f114332d8401e0949a3d\"\n}\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\" : \"BADREQUESTERROR\",\n    \"description\": \"payment processing failed because of incorrect otp\"\n  },\n  \"next\": [\"otpsubmit\", \"otpresend\"]\n}\n\nOTP Resend\n\nThere could be situations when the customer has to reenter the OTP sent to him. The number of retries that the user is allowed is determined by the issuing bank.\n\npayments/:id/otp/resend\n\ncurl -XPOST \\\n'https://api.razorpay.com/v1/payments/pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f/otp/resend' \\\n-u :\n-H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"\n{\n  \"next\": [\"otpsubmit\", \"otpresend\"],\n  \"razorpaypaymentid\": \"pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f\"\n}\n\n5. Verify the Payment\n\n@// No context about callback_url and need more clarifications\n\nOnce the payment process is completed, Razorpay will make a POST request to the callback_url on whether the payment was a success or a failure.\n\nYou can easily verify the payment signature using our SDKs:\n\nJSONObject paymentResponse = new JSONObject();\noptions.put(\"razorpayorderid\", \"order_9A33XWu170gUtm\");\noptions.put(\"razorpaypaymentid\", \"pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f\");\noptions.put(\"razorpay_signature\", \"9ef4dffbfd84f1318f6739a3ce19f9d85851857ae648f114332d8401e0949a3d\");\nUtils.verifyPaymentSignature(paymentResponse, \"\");\nparams = {\n  \"razorpayorderid\": \"order_9A33XWu170gUtm\",\n  \"razorpaypaymentid\": \"pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f\",\n  \"razorpay_signature\": \"9ef4dffbfd84f1318f6739a3ce19f9d85851857ae648f114332d8401e0949a3d\"\n}\nclient.utility.verifypaymentsignature(params_dict)\n$params = [\n  'razorpayorderid'     =>  'order_9A33XWu170gUtm',\n  'razorpaypaymentid'   =>  'pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f',\n  'razorpay_signature'    =>  '9ef4dffbfd84f1318f6739a3ce19f9d85851857ae648f114332d8401e0949a3d'\n];\nRazorpay\\Api\\Utility::verifyPaymentSignature($params);\nputs payment_response\n{\n:razorpayorderid   => \"order_9A33XWu170gUtm\",\n:razorpaypaymentid => \"pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f\",\n:razorpay_signature  => \"9ef4dffbfd84f1318f6739a3ce19f9d85851857ae648f114332d8401e0949a3d\"\n}\nRazorpay::Utility.verifypaymentsignature(payment_response)\n\nIf razorpaypaymentid is returned, the payment is successfully created and verified.\n\nPost-processing\n A successful transaction results in the creation of the razorpayorderid in your database. You can mark the corresponding transaction at your end as paid and notify the customer of the same.\n\nFailure\nAn exception is thrown in the event of an unsuccessful signature verification. If the razorpaypaymentid field is missing in the API request, the following error is displayed in the corresponding response body:\n\nerror%5Bcode%5D=BADREQUESTERROR&error%5Bdescription%5D=Payment+failed\n","url":"private/card-payment"},{"title":"Convenience Fees","index":false,"body":"\nIntroduction\n\nEvery time a customer makes a payment on your site, the transaction fees charged by us can be collected from your customers as Convenience fees.

Refer our Checkout form page to know how.\n\nCreating an Order request\nWhen a customer attempts to make a payment, the merchant server needs to send a\ncreate order request to Razorpay's server. In response, Razorpay returns an\norderid. This orderid has to be stored in your database corresponding to\nthe order on your end. The order_id needs to be passed to Razorpay Checkout on\nweb or mobile.\nYou can refer the Orders API documentation for more details.\n\nThe following snippet shows the order request parameters:\n\nSystem.Net.WebClient client = new System.Net.WebClient();\nclient.Headers.Add(\"content-type\", \"application/json\");\nobject response = client.UploadData(\n \"https://api.razorpay.com/v1/orders\",\n \"POST\",\n Encoding.Default.GetBytes(\n  \"{\\\"amount\\\": \\\"5000\\\",\\\"currency\\\": \\\"INR\\\",\\\"receipt\\\":\\\"Receipt#20\\\",\\\"payment_capture\\\":1}\"\n )\n)\n\ncurl -u rzptest26ccbdbfe0e84b:69b2e24411e384f91213f22a \\\n   -X POST \\\n   --data \"amount=5000\" \\\n   --data \"currency=INR\" \\\n   --data \"receipt=Receipt#20\" \\\n   --data \"payment_capture=1\" \\\n   https://api.razorpay.com/v1/orders\n Amount in paise: The amount is always taken in paise. In the above example 5000 corresponds to @data.Rs 50 (5000 paise).\n\nSubmitting the Checkout Form\n\nYou must pass the options to checkout.js via data attributes in the script tag. The script tag is enclosed within a form tag. Once the payment has been authorized, the form is auto-submitted to the URL set in action by you in the form tag.\n\nThe payment now proceeds as normal, in the customer's device. Once the payment is complete on the customer's device, Checkout will return the razorpaypaymentid, razorpayorderid and razorpay_signature. These parameters need to be passed to merchant's backend. The payment is considered complete at our end.\n\nThe razorpay_signature is returned to you by the Checkout form on successful transaction. This signature needs to be verified in your backend server. Refer the Verifying Signature page for more details. The payment for the merchant server should be marked as completed, only after verifying the signature. The following snippet details the signature verification process:\n\npublic void verifyPaymentSignature(string orderId, string paymentId, string expectedSignature)\n{\n  string secret = \"\"; //your secret\n  string payload = string.Format(\"{0}|{1}\", orderId, paymentId);\n\n  string actualSignature = getActualSignature(payload, secret);\n\n  bool verified = actualSignature.Equals(expectedSignature);\n\n  if (verified == false)\n  {\n    // Signature mismatch. reject payment\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    // Process Order\n  }\n}\n\nprivate string getActualSignature(string payload, string secret)\n{\n  var encoding = new ASCIIEncoding();\n  byte[] secretBytes = encoding.GetBytes(text)\n  var bytes = encoding.GetBytes(payload);\n\n  HMACSHA256 hashHmac = new HMACSHA256(secretBytes);\n  string hash = hashHmac.ComputeHash(bytes)\n\n  string signature = BitConverter.ToString(hash).Replace(\"-\", \"\").ToLower();\n  return signature;\n}\n\nFetching Payment Details\nTo get other details of the payment that has been processed, you can use the Fetch payment details API.

You can get in touch with us at https://razorpay.com/support for any queries.\n\nPCI Compliance:\nTo enable support for Server-to-server integration for card payments on your account, a PCI compliance certificate is mandatory. This certificate needs to be submitted and updated as per the yearly renewal cycle.\n\nYou can integrate Razorpay in your web application in three steps:\nCreating an order.\nCreating a payment.\nVerifying the payment.\n\n1. Creating an Order\n\nCreating an order is the first step to integrate Razorpay payments in your web application. Orders API allows you to create an order when a payment is expected from a customer.\n\nOn the frontend, this can be invoked by an on-click event allows customers to proceed to make payments. The orders API returns razorpayorderid which will be consumed for signature verfication after the payment is authorized.\n\nMake sure you store the razorpayorderid against the corresponding transaction. The below API endpoint will create an order at your server-side:\n\n/orders\n\nNote:\nFor authentication, you need to provide your keyid and keysecret in the Authentication HTTP header for Basic Auth. For example, https://rzptestKEYID:RZPKEY_SECRET@api.razorpay.com/v1/orders. This wikipedia page provides more details on the authentication mechanism used.\n\nA sample cURL request for creating an order is shown below:\n\ncurl -u rzptest26ccbdbfe0e84b:69b2e24411e384f91213f22a \\\n    https://api.razorpay.com/v1/orders\n    -X POST \\\n    --data \"amount=50000\" \\\n    --data \"currency=INR\" \\\n    --data \"receipt=Receipt #RCPTID43\" \\\n    --data \"payment_capture=1\"\n    https://api.razorpay.com/v1/orders\ntry {\n  JSONObject orderRequest = new JSONObject();\n  // amount in paise\n  orderRequest.put(\"amount\", 50000);\n  orderRequest.put(\"currency\", \"INR\");\n  orderRequest.put(\"receipt\", \"RCPTID43\");\n  orderRequest.put(\"payment_capture\", true);\n\n  Order order = razorpay.Orders.create(orderRequest);\n} catch (RazorpayException e) {\n  // Handle Exception\n  System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n}\norder_amount = 50000\norder_currency = 'INR'\norder_receipt = 'RCPTID43'\nnotes = {'details': 'A Wild Sheep Chase is the third novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami'}   # OPTIONAL\n\nclient.order.create(amount=50000, currency=INR, receipt=RCPTID43, notes=A Wild Sheep Chase is the third novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami, payment_capture='1')\n$order  = $client->order->create([\n  'receipt'         => 'RCPTID43',\n  // amount in paise\n  'amount'          => 50000,\n  'currency'        => 'INR',\n  'payment_capture' =>  '1'\n]);\nDictionary options = new Dictionary();\n// amount in paise\noptions.Add(\"amount\", 50000);\noptions.add(\"receipt\", \"RCPTID43\");\noptions.add(\"currency\", \"INR\");\noptions.add(\"payment_capture\", \"1\");\nOrder order = client.Order.Create(options);\noptions = amount: 50000, currency: 'INR', receipt: 'RCPTID43', payment_capture: '1'\norder = Razorpay::Order.create\nvar options = {\n  // amount in pase\n  amount: 50000,\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  receipt: \"RCPTID43\",\n  payment_capture: '1'\n};\ninstance.orders.create(options, function(err, order) {\n  console.log(order);\n});\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"order_4xbQrmEoA5WJ0G\",\n  \"entity\": \"order\",\n  \"amount\": 50000,\n  \"currency\": \"INR\",\n  \"receipt\": \"Receipt RCPTID43\",\n  \"status\": \"created\",\n  \"attempts\": 0,\n  \"created_at\": 1455696638,\n  \"notes\": {}\n}\n\nRefer the Orders API Reference section to learn more about orders.\n\n2. Creating a Payment\n\nOnce an order is created, your next step is to create a payment. The following API will create a payment:\n\n/payments/create/redirect\n\nThe following fields can be passed:\n\ncurrency\n: INR Default and the only supported currency value.\n\namount\n: Integer value in paisa. For example, for ₹20, amount should be 2000.\n\nemail\n: Email address of the customer. For example, gaurav.kumar@example.com\n\ncontact\n: Contact of the customer. For example, 9123456789\n\nmethod\n: one of card netbanking wallet emi upi\n\nvpa\n: Virtual Payment Address of the customer. Required if method = upi. You can use failure@razorpay in test mode to simulate the failure cases.\n\ncard[number]\n: Unformatted card number. Required if value of method field is card. Use our test card - 4242424242424242.\n\ncard[name]\n: Cardholder's name.\n\ncard[expiry_month]\n: Expiry month for card in MM format. January starts from 01.\n\ncard[expiry_year]\n: Expiry year for card in YY format.\n\ncard[cvv]\n: CVV printed on back side of card\n\nbank\n: Required bank code if value of method field is netbanking. For example, SBIN\n\nwallet\n: Required wallet code if value of method field is wallet. For example, mobikwik\n\nnotes\n: Optional key-value pair represented as JSON object.\n\ncallback_url\n: Mandatory URL, where we will submit the final payment status.\n\nip\n: Client IP Address. Mandatory.\n\nreferrer\n: Client referrer. Mandatory.\n\nuser_agent\n: Client User-agent. Mandatory.\n\nauth_type\n: For card payments, this parameter will have debitpin as the value. For example, authtype=debit_pin\n\nNote: Send the data as form-urlencoded format, which will ensure that nested keys are correctly passed.\n\nResponses\n\nThe following are the types of possible responses for a create payment request:\n\n200 Success\n\nThis can happen only in the case of international cards, where there is no two-factor authentication. Use 555555555555558 as the card number to test this flow.\nWhen a payment is successful, we will return 200 OK success response along with the following fields:\n\n  razorpaypaymentid\n  razorpayorderid\n  razorpay_signature\n\nNote:\nIf International cards are disabled for your account, you will get an immediate error response for the entered card number, which should be handled as done for Validation Errors.\n\n302 Redirect\n\nIn the case of a 302 Redirect response, you can fetch the target URL from the header location which can be used to redirect your customers. This occurs when we need to redirect to bank/wallet page via a GET request. You can test this flow using the following test card number - 4111111111111111\n\nHTML Form Post\n\nIn this case, the response will be an HTML content that needs to be opened in the customer's browser. This HTML content contains a bunch of form-fields which will be automatically posted to the bank/wallet URL (specified in the form) to continue with the payment process.\nThis case occurs when you need to redirect users to the bank/wallet page via a POST request. You can test this flow using the following test card number - 4012001037141112\n\nValidation Error\n\nFor validation errors such as invalid card number and incorrect currency, we will send an error response. Refer the error codes and their description.\n\nIf a redirection was involved (in the Redirect/HTML Form post case), then as final result of the payment process, we will make a POST request on the callbackurl specified originally during payment creation. For successful payments, the POST parameter will be razorpaypayment_id.\n\nNote: If the response is missing the razorpaypaymentid field, the POST parameters will be an error dictionary containing the following fields:\n\ncode\ndescription\nfield\n\nFor example, if you send a wrong card number, we will immedaitely return a 400 error with the following response:\n\n{\n  \"error\": {\n  \"code\": \"BADREQUESTERROR\"\n  }\n}\n\n3. Verifying the Payment\n\nOnce the payment process completes, you will receive a POST request at callback_url. The data will depend on whether the payment was a success or a failure:\n\nFailure\n\nIf the response is missing the razorpaypaymentid field, we will return the error and its description in the form of a POST request. A sample URL encoded failure request returned is shown below:\n\nerror%5Bcode%5D=BADREQUESTERROR&error%5Bdescription%5D=Payment+failed\n\nThe key-value parameters of the request is shown below:\n\nerror[code]\n: BADREQUESTERROR\n\nerror[description]\n: Payment failed\n\nPost-processing\nIf the payment is a success, you can find the razorpayorderid in your database, and mark the corresponding transaction at your end as paid and notify the customer of the same.\n\nSuccess\n\nThe following fields will be passed:\n\nrazorpaypaymentid\nrazorpayorderid\nrazorpay_signature\n\nYou can rely on the razorpaypaymentid to trigger the success flow. You can easily verify the payment signature using our SDKs:\n\nJSONObject paymentResponse = new JSONObject();\noptions.put(\"razorpayorderid\", \"\");\noptions.put(\"razorpaypaymentid\", \"\");\noptions.put(\"razorpay_signature\", \"\");\nUtils.verifyPaymentSignature(paymentResponse, \"\");\nparams = {\n  \"razorpayorderid\": \"\",\n  \"razorpaypaymentid\": \"\",\n  \"razorpay_signature\": \"\"\n}\nclient.utility.verifypaymentsignature(params_dict)\n$params = [\n  'razorpayorderid'     =>  '',\n  'razorpaypaymentid'   =>  '',\n  'razorpay_signature'    =>  ''\n];\nRazorpay\\Api\\Utility::verifyPaymentSignature($params);\nputs payment_response\n{\n:razorpayorderid   => \"\",\n:razorpaypaymentid => \"\",\n:razorpay_signature  => \"\"\n}\nRazorpay::Utility.verifypaymentsignature(payment_response)\n\nThe signature verification failure will throw an exception.\n\nPost-processing\nIf the payment is a success, you can find the razorpayorderid in your database, and mark the corresponding transaction at your end as paid and notify the customer of the same.\n\n{\n   \"error\": {\n      \"code\": \"BADREQUESTERROR\",\n      \"description\": \"Wrong card number\",\n      \"field\": \"number\"\n  }\n}\n\n3. Verifying the Payment\n\nOnce the payment process is completed, you will receive a POST request at callback_url. The data will depend on whether the payment was a success or a failure:\n\nSuccess\n\nThe following fields will be passed:\n\nrazorpaypaymentid\nrazorpayorderid\nrazorpay_signature\n\nYou can rely on the razorpaypaymentid to trigger the success flow. You can easily verify the payment signature using our SDKs:\n\nJSONObject paymentResponse = new JSONObject();\noptions.put(\"razorpayorderid\", \"\");\noptions.put(\"razorpaypaymentid\", \"\");\noptions.put(\"razorpay_signature\", \"\");\nUtils.verifyPaymentSignature(paymentResponse, \"\");\nparams = {\n  \"razorpayorderid\": \"\",\n  \"razorpaypaymentid\": \"\",\n  \"razorpay_signature\": \"\"\n}\nclient.utility.verifypaymentsignature(params_dict)\n$params = [\n  'razorpayorderid'     =>  '',\n  'razorpaypaymentid'   =>  '',\n  'razorpay_signature'    =>  ''\n];\nRazorpay\\Api\\Utility::verifyPaymentSignature($params);\nputs payment_response\n{\n:razorpayorderid   => \"\",\n:razorpaypaymentid => \"\",\n:razorpay_signature  => \"\"\n}\nRazorpay::Utility.verifypaymentsignature(payment_response)\n\nThe signature verification failure will throw an exception.\n\nPost-processing\nIf the payment is a success, you can find the razorpayorderid in your database, and mark the corresponding transaction at your end as paid and notify the customer of the same.\n\nA successful response for this route would be a 200 JSON object:\n\ncurl -X POST -u rzptest26ccbdbfe0e84b:69b2e24411e384f91213f22a -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" -d \"amount=100&currency=INR&contact=9123456780&email=gaurav.kumar@example.com&flow=otp\" \"https://api.razorpay.com/v1/payments/create/card\"\n{\n  \"id\": \"pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f\",\n  \"entity\": \"payment\",\n  \"amount\": 100,\n  \"currency\": \"INR\",\n  \"status\": \"captured\",\n  \"method\": \"card\",\n  \"description\": \"Payment for adidas shoes\",\n  \"amount_refunded\": 0,\n  \"refund_status\": null,\n  \"email\": \"gaurav.kumar@example.com\",\n  \"contact\": \"9123456780\",\n  \"notes\": {},\n  \"fee\": 1145,\n  \"tax\": 145,\n  \"error_code\": null,\n  \"error_description\": null,\n  \"created_at\": 1400826750\n}\n\nFailure\n\nIf the response is missing the razorpaypaymentid field, we will return the error and its description in the form of a POST request.

Building a checkout interface is your next step after integrating Razorpay Orders to get an entire payment ecosystem up and running.\n\nRazorpay Checkout is a beautifully designed and well-tested user interface for collecting\npayment information from customers. However, for a custom checkout form, you can utilize razorpay.js for the creation and authorization parts of the payment flow.\n\nThe customer's payment information should never reach your servers, unless you are PCI DSS certified.\n\nUsage Guide\n\nInclude the following script, preferably in `` section of your document:\n\nIncluding the Library:\n\nIncluding the script from https://checkout.razorpay.com/v1/razorpay.js instead of serving a copy from your own server,\nallows new updates and bug fixes to the library to get automatically served to your application.\nWe always maintain backward compatiblity.\n\nAfter this, you can instantiate Razorpay through:\n\nvar razorpay = new Razorpay({\n  key: '',\n    // logo, we'll display it in payment processing popup\n  image: 'https://i.imgur.com/n5tjHFD.png',\n});\n\nIf you need multiple razorpay instances on same page, you can globally set some of the options:\n\nRazorpay.configure({\n  key: '',\n    // logo, we'll display it in payment processing popup\n  image: 'https://i.imgur.com/n5tjHFD.png',\n})\nnew Razorpay({}); // will inherit key and image from above.\n\nGetting Payment Methods\n\nYou can accept payment through UPI, Credit/Debit cards, Netbanking and Wallets,\ndepending on the methods that have been enabled for your account.\nWhen you use checkout.js, you do not need to handle the availability of different payment methods.\nHowever, when you are creating a custom checkout form,\nyou would want to ensure that only the methods that are activated for your account\nare displayed to the customer.\n\nThis is also needed to get the list of banks for netbanking. To get the available payment methods:\n\nvar razorpay = new Razorpay(...); // as before\nrazorpay.once('ready', function(response) {\n  console.log(response.methods);\n  // response.methods.netbanking contains list of all banks\n})\n\nResponse for ready event is of format:\n\n{\n  \"card\": true,     // Boolean\n  \"netbanking\": {   // map of bank codes vs. display names\n      \"SBIN\": \"State Bank of India\"\n      \"UTIB\": \"Axis Bank\"\n      // ...\n  },\n  \"wallet\": {\n    \"mobikwik\": true\n  },\n  \"emi\": true\n}\n\nNote:\nmethods object may contain additional parameters like wallets, if enabled for your account.\n\nSubmitting Payment Details\n\nAfter an order is created and the customer's payment information is obtained, this information should be sent to Razorpay to complete the payment. The data that needs to be submitted depends upon the payment method selected by the customer.\n\nYou can do this by invoking createPayment method:\n\nvar data = {\n  amount: 1000, // in paise, 1000 equals ₹10\n  email: 'gaurav.kumar@example.com',\n  contact: '9123456780',\n  notes: {\n    custom_field: 'Name on the card'\n  },\n  orderid: 'order9A33XWu170gUtm',\n  method: 'netbanking',\n\n  // method specific fields\n  bank: 'HDFC'\n};\n\n$btn.on('click', function(){\n  // has to be placed within user initated context, such as click in order for popup to open.\n  razorpay.createPayment(data);\n\n  razorpay.on('payment.success', function(resp) {\n    alert(resp.razorpaypaymentid),\n    alert(resp.razorpayorderid),\n    alert(resp.razorpay_signature)}); // will pass payment ID, order ID, and Razorpay signature to success handler.\n\n  razorpay.on('payment.error', function(resp){alert(resp.error.description)}); // will pass error object to error handler\n\n})\n\nNote:\n\ncreatePayment should be called within an event listener triggered by user action, to prevent the popup from being blocked. For example:\n\n$('button').click( function (){ razorpay.createPayment(...) })\n\nSuccess/Error Callbacks\n\nWhen submitting user details, you can create JavaScript callbacks that will be triggered\nfor every payment successes and errors.\n\nThe success callback will receive plain JavaScript object containing the keys; razorpaypaymentid, razorpayorderid, razorpaysignature. The razorpaysignature must be verified for a payment to be considered successful. Learn how to verify the Razorpay signature\n\n{\n  \"razorpaypaymentid\": \"pay_8qDI3ZfhYGuh6v\",\n  \"razorpayorderid\": \"order_9A33XWu170gUtm\",\n  \"razorpay_signature\": \"9ef4dffbfd84f1318f6739a3ce19f9d85851857ae648f114332d8401e0949a3d\"\n}\n\nwhereas error callback will receive an object of following format:\n\n{\n    \"error\": {\n        \"field\": \"email\",\n        \"description\": \"incorrect email address\"\n    }\n}\n\nThe field inside the error object represents the errored field, for example, card[expiry_month], or email  that is returned when the user input in invalid.\n\nvar error = function(response){\n    var error_obj = response.error;\n    console.log(error_obj.description);\n    if(error_obj.field)\n        $('input[name=' + error_obj.field+']').addClass('invalid');\n}\n\nRazorpay Orders allows you to enable auto capturing of the payments using the paymentcapture option. This tells Razorpay to capture payments on your behalf once the creation and authorization parts of the payment flow have been completed. If you wish to capture payment manually, you will need to send paymentcapture=0 while creating orders, and then use the payment capture API.

A payout is made to a contact (similar to a “beneficiary” in banking terminology).

Failure is possible at several points, at Razorpay, at the contact's bank, or elsewhere. In some rare scenarios, failure might happen a few days after the payout is moved to the processed state.\n\nAs soon as Razorpay detects a failure, we creates a reversal transaction and credit the payout amount (including the fees & tax) back to your business account. The original payout transaction status is changed to Reversed.\n\nAnytime a payout fails, a webhook is triggered to notify of the failure.

For every payout you need to specify the amount, the contact and the purpose of the payout.\n\nThe payout amount and the payout charges are deducted from your business account balance every time a payout is made. These appear as a debit against business account on the successful creation of a payout.\n\nIn case a payout fails at any stage of its processing, a reversal is created which results in a credit to your business account.\n\nUse cases\n\nPayouts can be used for any type of business requirement. A few samples use cases are provided below.\n\nRecurring Vendor Payments\n\nBusinesses need to make payouts to their vendors at regular intervals for the goods delivered and services rendered. These payouts are generally recurring in nature and are thus planned payouts. Such use cases can be served by making NEFT and RTGS payouts to vendor contacts.\n\nCustomer Refunds and Cashbacks\n\nB2C businesses generally have to deal with customer refunds and cashbacks. These payouts need to be done immediately, if not can lead to negative customer experience, loss in reputation and brand value and ultimately reduction in sales. IMPS and UPI based payouts through APIs can help firms automate their refunds and cashback processes and ensure they are instantaneous.\n\nLoan Disbursements by Financial Institutions\n\nFinancial Institutions such as NBFCs and Lending Aggregators need to disburse loans to their borrowers as soon as the loan is sanctioned. They cannot afford to lose business due to non working hours of banks. IMPS based payouts helps these firms provide instantaneous payouts and thus improve borrower experience.\n\nPayout Life Cycle\n\nBelow is a high level diagrammatic overview of the payout life cycle in RazorpayX.\n\nA payout can have the following statuses during its life cycle:\n\nProcessing\nProcessed\nReversed\n\nRazorpay will inform you about status changes at every stage via webhooks. You can also check the status of a payout in the Payouts section of the dashboard.\n\nProcessing\n\nWhen a payout is created, it immediately acquires the processing status. At this stage either Razorpay or the contact's bank could be processing the payout. No further action is required by you  while a payout is in the processing state.\n\nFrom processing state, payout can either move to the processed or the reversed state.\n\nProcessed\n\nThe processed status means that payout has been processed by the contact's Bank.\n\nA payout in processed state can move to the reversed state if a payout failure is detected. This can happen due to various reasons such as the customer's bank reversing the transaction or if the payout was reversed by the clearing house, etc.\n\nReversed\n\nA payout acquires the reversed state when the payout operation fails. This can happen due to issues with our partner banks, clearing house or even the customer's bank.\n\nAs soon as Razorpay identifies a payout failure scenario, it moves the payout to the reversed state and creates a reversal transaction that credits your business account with the original payout amount including fees & tax.\n\nPayout Mode\n\nThe following modes are available while making payouts to a contact’s fund account. The limitations of the modes are listed in the below table.\n\nMethod|Amount|Credited\n\nNEFT|Any amount|Credited within 2 working hours\n\nIMPS|Upto Rs. 2 lakh|Credited immediately on all days\n\nRTGS|Above Rs. 2 lakhs|Credited immediately during working hours\n\nUPI|Upto Rs. 1 lakh|Credited immediately\n\nNEFT, IMPS and RTGS modes are available only for fund account with the type ‘bank account’. UPI payout mode is available for fund account with type ‘VPA’.\n\nPayout Purpose\n\nA purpose has to be defined for every payout made from RazorpayX. This helps categorize and analyze the payouts. The following types are available in the system by default:\n\nRefund\nCashback\nPayout\nSalary\nUtility bill\nVendor bill\n\nHowever, you are not restricted to only these purposes for your payouts.

So, you need not create these at your end.\n\n1. Create First Payment using Authorization Link\n\nYou can create Authorization Links on the Dashboard through which customers are able to make the First Payment. To create an Authorization Link, you need to do the following:\n\nLog in to Razorpay Dashboard.\nNavigate to Subscription --> Authorization Links.\nClick +Create New Link.\nThis displays the Create Authorization Link window.\nEnter the following details:\n\n    ---\n    Description | Description of the Authorization Link. This helps you identify the Authorization Link from the list of previously created links.\n    ---\n    Customer Name | Name of the customer. This should be the same as the one created using the API.\n    ---\n    Customer Contact | Phone number and Email address of the customer\n    ---\n    Notify | There two ways in which you can send notifications:- SMS- Email\n    ---\n    Receipt No. | The order reference number created at your end.\n    ---\n    Expiry | The expiry date of the link\n    ---\n    Payment Method | The mode of payment for the authentication payment: - Card - Emandate\n    ---\n    Amount | The payment amount\n    ---\n    Bank Details | This includes - Bank Name- IFSC.\n    ---\n    Account Details | This includes- Beneficiary Name- Account Number\n    ---\n    Authentication | Currently we only support Netbanking authentication\n    ---\n    Token Expiry | Expiry date of the Token\n    ---\n    Token Max Amount | Maximum Token amount\n    ---\n    Internal Notes | Notes for internal use.\n    ---\n\nAfter you have finish filling in all the details, click Create Authorization Link.\nThis redirects you to the checkout page where the customer creates the First Payment.\n\nNote:\nYou can also create a First Payment via the API workflow, refer to API Reference.\n\nTip:\n The Razorpay Dashboard also allows you to create and issue Authorization Links in Batches. Learn how to create Authorization Links in Batch.\n\nOnce the First Payment is successfully created, you need to wait for the payment to reach the captured state.\n\n2. View the Payment Status\n\nWhenever an First Payment is created, the corresponding paymentid appears on the list of created payments along with its orderid.\n\nNoteIf you have used an Authorization Link to create the First Payment, Razorpay automatically creates an Order for the payment.\n\nLearn about the different payment status\n\n3. Search for the Token\n\nOnce the status of the First Payment is captured, a Token is generated against a payment_id. This appears on the list of generated tokens.\n\nNote: Tokens are not returned as a part of the checkout response. However, you can view them on the Dashboard. You can also view the details of the Token using APIs or Webhooks.\n\nLog in to Razorpay Dashboard.\nNavigate to Subscription --> Tokens.\nSearch for the token using the token_id.\n\nOnce the token is confirmed, you can charge the Token.\n\n4. Charge the Token\n\nOn the Dashboard, Recurring Payments are created by charging the Token. Charging a token after it gets confirmed creates a Recurring Payment.\n\nTo charge a token:\nLog in to Razorpay Dashboard.\nNavigate to Subscription --> Tokens.\nSearch for the token using the token_id.\nClick on the token_id to open the details page.\nClick Charge Now to create a recurring payment.\n\nBatch Operations in Dashboard\n\nThe Razorpay Dashboard also allows you to create Recurring Payments in Batches.\n\nFor larger businesses with the capability to process a large number of e-Mandate registration, Razorpay allows merchants to issue Authorization Links and create Recurring Payments using Tokens in bulk.\n\nWhile creating Authorization Links or charging Tokens can be a fairly simple way of collecting payments from your customers, generating them for large volumes of orders can become challenging. Especially for businesses that accept a majority of their payment through Authorization Links and have issuing them as a part of their process.\n\nUploading a single file (often called the batch file) containing the required details for a collection of orders allows us to generate and process the Authorization Links in bulk instead of creating individual links.\n\nBatch File Format\n\nA batch file is a simple .xlsx or .csv file that contains all the necessary details to create Authorization Links for a list of Receipts. The fields required to create a batch file are:\n\nname\nName of the Customer\n\nemail\nEmail address of the Customer\n\nphone\nContact number of the Customer\n\namount\nThe order amount\n\ncurrency\nThe currency of payment.

To ensure same day debit authorization, Razorpay must receive the request by 8:59 AM on a bank working day.\n\n5. Who controls the debit schedule frequency and amount?\nThe recurring payments feature allows merchant to charge customers automatically at regular intervals that are defined and controlled by the merchant. Essentially, Razorpay processes recurring payments as-and-when-presented by the merchant.\n\n6. What is the settlement timeline for subsequent payments?\nThe complete settlement process takes T+3 working days, T being the date of payment capture. In certain cases, this could take longer if the settlement date falls on a bank holiday. In case the settlement is scheduled on a bank holiday; the settlement occurs on the next working day.\n\n7. How to track the status of subsequent payments?\nYou can track real-time status of payments as Created, Processed, Failed via Razorpay Dashboard or APIs.\n\n8. How do I track fund settlements?\nYou can track settlements using UTR (Unique Transaction Reference). The settlement report is available via the Razorpay Dashboard or via Settlement API.\n\n9. How can a customer cancel standing instructions on a credit card or E-Mandate?\nYou can call the Delete token API to cancel the standing instruction or delete the recurring payment.\n\n10. I have a valid token, but the recurring payment failed. What would be the reason?\nThere could be various reasons why a recurring payment could fail. The potential reason could be expired credit card, insufficient funds, credit card reported lost or stolen or recurring payment cancelled directly from the bank.\n\n11. What is the maximum amount per debit request for E-Mandate?\nIn case of e-Mandate (Netbanking Auth), the maximum amount is @data.Rs 99,999.\n\n12.

In order to recover the amount from linked accounts,\nthe reverse_all parameter can be set to 1 in the refund POST request. This will\nrecover the amount from linked accounts for every transfer made on the payment,\nbefore processing the refund to the customer.\n\nNote: The reverse_all attribute is optional. You may also choose to manually\nreverse transfers created on a payment by using the /transfers/:id/reversals which\nis described later in this document.\n\nAutomated Reversals\n\nReversals can be automated with the reverse_all attribute in the following refund\nscenarios:\n\nFull refund\nPartial refund for a payment transferred to a single account.\n\nFor partial refunds on a payment transferred to multiple accounts - the reverse_all\nparameter cannot be applied, since Razorpay cannot determine which transfer to\npartially reverse. You will have to use the transfer reversal API to achieve reversals\non this payment.\n\nIn the example given on the side, the amount specified in the amount parameter\n(that is, 15000) is the amount that will be refunded to the customer. The amount\nthat will be recovered from the linked accounts is the sum of all transfers made\nto each of those accounts, for the payment_id.\n\ncurl https://api.razorpay.com/v1/payments/pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA/refund \\\n   -u {KEY}:{SECRET} \\\n   -d 'amount=15000' \\\n   -d 'reverse_all=1'\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"rfnd_6ye1vPrRFo6TdA\",\n  \"entity\": \"refund\",\n  \"amount\": 15000,\n  \"currency\": \"INR\",\n  \"paymentid\": \"pay6ydSup2U7aFMsA\",\n  \"notes\": {},\n  \"created_at\": 1482998305\n}\n\nA new reversal entity is created internally and linked for every reversals defined\nby the transfer_id.\n\nThe attributes of the reversal entity are defined below:\n\nid string\n: Reversal ID\n\ntransfer_id string\n: Transfer ID that was reversed.\n\namount integer\n: Amount reversed\n\ncurrency string\n: 3 character ISO currency code.\n\ncreated_at timestamp\n: Timestamp when the reversal was created.\n\nDirect Transfers\nYou can transfer funds to your linked accounts directly without linking any payments to\nit.

If set, Razorpay will hold the settlement of the transfer to the linked\naccount until the timestamp provided elapses.\n\nExamples\n\non_hold parameter\nSuppose the settlement scheduled for a linked account - acc_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7\nwas defined as T+10 days, the transfer created with the request defined below\nwill not be settled after 10\ndays - as long as the hold is maintained. If the hold is disabled on T+15, the\namount will be settled to the linked account by the next working day.\n\nonholduntil parameter\nIf a transfer is created with onholduntil timestamp defined, we will hold the\nsettlement of this transfer to the linked account until the timestamp defined has\nelapsed. Once elapsed, the transfer amount will be settled to the linked account by\nthe next working day.\n\nWhen using this parameter, on_hold must be sent and set to 1. Additionally,\nthe timestamp value provided must be greater than the current timestamp.\n\nSettlement Schedule Override\n\nThe settlement schedule defined for the linked account takes higher preference over\nthe onhold and onhold_until functionality. This simply means that defined\nsettlement schedule is the the minimum time required for the transfer to be settled.\n\nExamples:\nFor a T+10 settlement schedule -\n\nIf a transfer was created with on_hold=1 and then released on day T+7, the settlement\nwill only go out on day T+10.\nIf a transfer was created with onhold=1 and onhold_until=1491567400 (assume the\ntimestamp 1491567400 corresponds to 7 days after transfer) - then transfer's on_hold\nwill change to false on day T+7, but the settlement will only go out on day T+10.\n\nIn the example request given below, a transfer of INR 10000 to accountid acca1b2c3d4e5f6g7\nis created and put on hold.\n\ncurl https://api.razorpay.com/v1/payments/pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA/transfer \\\n   -u {KEY}:{SECRET} \\\n   -d 'transfers0=acc_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7' \\\n   -d 'transfers0=10000' \\\n   -d 'transfers0=INR' \\\n   -d 'transfers0=1'\n\n{\n  \"entity\": \"collection\",\n  \"count\": 1,\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"trf_6ydVYyzaICeIw5\",\n      \"entity\": \"transfer\",\n      \"source\": \"pay_6ydSup2U7aFMsA\",\n      \"recipient\": \"acc_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7\",\n      \"amount\": 10000,\n      \"amount_reversed\": 0,\n      \"on_hold\": true,\n      \"tax\": 16,\n      \"fees\": 4,\n      \"created_at\": 1482996461\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n/transfers/:id\n\nThe transfer hold settings can be modified anytime by sending a PATCH request on the transfer_id.\nOn successful request, the API responds with the modified transfer entity.\n\nNote: You cannot change this setting after the transfer has been settled to the linked account.\n\ncurl -XPATCH https://api.razorpay.com/v1/transfers/trf_6ydVYyzaICeIw5 \\\n   -u {KEY}:{SECRET} \\\n   -d 'on_hold=1'\n{\n  \"id\": \"trf_6ydVYyzaICeIw5\",\n  \"entity\": \"transfer\",\n  \"source\": \"pay_714hrl4xiFqxpA\",\n  \"recipient\": \"cust_70dOp5b7dFEeQl\",\n  \"amount\": 10000,\n  \"currency\": \"INR\",\n  \"amount_reversed\": 0,\n  \"on_hold\": true,\n  \"tax\": 16,\n  \"fees\": 4,\n  \"created_at\": 1483528953\n}\n\nWebhooks\n\nGetting notified about processed settlements gives you more control over the transfers made towards the linked accounts. When a settlement against a transfer is processed, a webhook event called settlement.processed is triggered which notifies your system about the same by POSTing a JSON sample payload. An example payload for this webhook event is given below:\n\n{\n  'entity':'event',\n  'accountid':'acc6koWN7bvxujzxM',\n  'event':'settlement.processed',\n  'contains':['settlement'],\n  'payload':{\n    'settlement': {\n      'entity':\n        {\n          'id':'setl_9RNjHCsa88ldH4',\n          'entity':'settlement',\n          'amount':29900,\n          'status':'processed',\n          'fees':0,\n          'tax':0,\n          'utr':'KKBKH15401228484',\n          'created_at':1516346930\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n    'created_at':1516346932\n    }\n    'webhook_id': '9RNjGS70SODdmX'\n}\n\n  Note: Since the transaction is processed, the payload will include the UTR number.\n\nYou can integrate this webhook and receive the payload as and when the settlement.processed event occurs.

It lets you split payments between various third parties,\nsellers or bank accounts and manage settlements, refunds, and reconciliations\nsingularly. This solution is fit for any business that needs to disburse payments\nin one-to-many model.\n\nRazorpay Route eases out payment complexity that inherently arises while working\nwith multiple vendors or accounts.\n\n@image route_introduction.png\n\nUse Cases\nListed below are business models across industries that can benefit from Razorpay\nRoute:\n\nMultiple Bank Accounts\nA business can have multiple bank accounts for various reasons and may want to\nroute payments to these accounts based on some rules, such as:\nRoute payments based on geography\nCentralize and schedule payouts to bank accounts based on business requirement\nControl settlement schedules for each account.\n\nFor example, Acme Corporation is a business operating in various locations in\nIndia such as Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Delhi, etc. It collects\npayments centrally and disburses payments via bank accounts created for every\nlocation. If Chennai location makes a sale of say @data.Rs 10,000 for the month and\nHyderabad location makes @data.Rs 15,000, Acme Corporation has to process the respective\npayouts and decide the settlement schedules for each.\n\nOnline Marketplace\nA business that is essentially a platform created by a merchant but the products\nand services being sold by this merchant are provided through third party sellers too.\n\nLet’s take an example: an e-commerce site is run by Acme Corporation. When a\ncustomer buys a phone (₹ 10,000, let’s say) and a case (₹ 500, let’s say) for\nit, the phone could be sold by Seller A, while the case by Seller B. Acme\nCorporation collects the payment from the customer and then has to send the\nmoney over to Seller A and Seller B. Acme Corporation will probably also charge\nthese sellers because their platform was used.\n\nOn Demand Services\nBusinesses that offer its customers various services like home repairs, delivery\nand courier, health and wellness, etc. and need to make payouts to service providers\non demand.\n\nTake for example, a company, Acme Corporation that provides various services to\nits customers and routes payments to its service providers based on the services\nrendered. Let’s say, a customer avails plumber’s service worth ₹ 1500, and an\nelectrician’s service worth ₹ 1000, Acme Corporation would have to split payments\nagainst the service provided for each service provider after deducting the commission\ncharges.\n\nBuild Your Custom Use Case\nRazorpay Route can be extended and utilised in all models where you need to\nautomate disbursal of funds to one or more bank accounts. If you'd like to\nexplore how Razorpay Route will best fit your unique business model, you can get in touch with us at razorpay.com/support for any queries.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe Razorpay Route platform is based upon Razorpay’s existing payment flow, which\nis described here. If you are new\nto Razorpay, we recommend understanding this before you go ahead with the rest\nof the document.\n\nWhat We Offer\n\nWith Razorpay Route, you can manage, control and get complete visibility\nof fund movements between you, your sellers and customers alike. As a\nmerchant, you take charge of what funds needs to be transferred,\nrefunded, and settled, a la carte.\n\nBy simply onboarding your sellers as Linked Accounts on Razorpay’s platform,\nyou can get started with moving your funds to your seller accounts.\n\nWith Razorpay Route, you will be able to:\nCreate and manage linked accounts\nSplit payments and transfer funds to multiple linked accounts\nCreate reversals of transferred funds and manage customer refunds with\nautomated reversals\nManage linked account settlements\nMove from manual and file based reconciliation to completely API driven, and more\n\nUsing Webhooks\n\nYou can enable the webhook settlement.processed to receive webhook alerts when a transfer made to a linked account is settled. A sample webhook payload for the webhook settlement.processed is available here. To learn more about our Webhooks click here.\n\nTerms Used\n\nLinked Accounts\n: Accounts created for third party sellers by the merchant after\nonboarding them onto the Razorpay platform.\n\nOnboarding\n: The process of adding individual sellers to the Razorpay platform by the merchant.\nThis process requires submission and verification of mandatory documents.\n\nFunds\n: Payments collected from the customer against an order placed on the e-commerce site.\n\nTransfer\n: The process of moving funds from the merchant’s account to the\nlinked account.\n\nReversal\n: The process of moving the transferred funds back to the merchant’s\naccount, which is initiated by the merchant.\n\nSettlement\n: The process of completing a payment transaction, wherein Razorpay\ndoes a transfer of pending funds to the bank account of the merchant and their linked accounts.\n\nRefund\n: The process of returning funds to the customers from linked accounts.\n","url":"route"},{"title":"Account Onboarding","desc":"Add vendors to transfer payments on Razorpay Route via Dashboard by creating linked accounts. You need to add primary details and bank details.","body":"To start moving funds to your seller accounts, you need to onboard your sellers\nto Razorpay Route first. You can onboard these sellers on the Razorpay Dashboard.\n\nWhen you onboard a seller, a linked account is created which essentially allows\nyou to view and manage all fund movements such as transfers, reversals, refunds,\netc. thus giving you complete visibility and control.\n\nEvery linked account has a unique account_id which should be stored in\nyour database. This ID should be sent in the various API's described in further\nsections to identify the linked account.\n\n Note: After onboarding an account, the linked account gets activated immediately and funds can be transferred right away. However, it takes 2 working days for the linked account settlements, irrespective of your settlement schedule.\n\nRequired Details\n\nThe following details are collected by us during the account onboarding -\n\nPrimary details\n: 1. Linked Account name\n  Contact number\n\nBank details\n: 1. Account number\n  Account type\n  IFSC\n  Beneficiary name\n\nGrant Dashboard Access to Linked Accounts\n\nYou can grant dashboard access to your linked accounts. Once the access is granted, the linked account can log in with an existing email address or can directly add and edit an email address.\n\nThe recipient linked account would be notified of this action via mail along with a password reset option.\n\nDashboard Access\nOnce logged in, linked accounts can invite other team members to manage their account.\n\nThe whole linked account dashboard is read-only.\n\nNote\n- You can grant dashboard access to linked accounts only if they have provided an email address for those accounts.\n- You cannot access the linked account dashboard unless they add you as a team member from their linked account dashboard. This is not required as you can view all the details and reports of the linked account on your own dashboard.\n","url":"route/onboarding"},{"title":"Route Operations","desc":"With Razorpay Route, create payments, transfers, direct transfers, reversals and schedule payment settlements by using settlements on hold and on hold until parameters.","body":"Transfers and Reversals are the two core operations that enable you to move\nfunds between you and your linked accounts. This section of the document\ndescribes these operations and its features.\n\nAs a merchant, you can transfer funds to single or multiple linked\naccounts, create refunds, reversals and define settlement cycles for your\nsellers.\n\nAll fund movements are initiated only by you, as a merchant and any\nmovement of funds can be viewed and tracked via the Dashboard and API.\n\nPayments on Razorpay Route\nRoute operations apply on payments that have been captured. The\nPayment Flow explains the\ndifferent states of a payment.\n\nIf you are an existing Razorpay merchant, your current Razorpay integration for\naccepting payments from customers will stay exactly the same with no changes.\nWith Razorpay Route enabled, you will have the option of transferring these\npayments to linked accounts. Any payment amount that is not transferred will\nbe settled to your bank account as it usually does.\n\nTransfers\nBased on the payments you receive, you can initiate funds transfer to your\nlinked accounts. You can also delay transfer settlements, if need be. You can\ntransfer the entire payment amount captured to a linked account, provided you have\nthe required balance in your Razorpay account.\n\nOnce the transferred amount is settled, a settlement.processed webhook is triggered.\n\nNote: Only those payments that have been captured can be transferred. See\nPayment Flow to know about how to\ncapture payments.\n\nThe flow in which the funds move here are:\nCustomer makes a purchase on the merchant site.\nMerchant transfers the funds to their linked accounts. The merchant can choose\nto,\n    Defer the transfer from being settled.\n    Define a time until which the transfer settlement should be delayed\nRazorpay settles funds to the linked account and sends a webhook payload to the merchant.\n\n@image route_transfers.svg\n\nDirect Transfers\nIn general, Razorpay expects all transfer requests to have a source payment.\nHowever, in order to enable specific business use-cases, we provide an option of\ncreating direct transfer of funds from merchant to linked account.\n\nReversals\n\nWhen funds transferred to your linked account needs to be reversed for reasons\nsuch as refund, adjustment, etc. you can initiate a reversal operation. You can\ninitiate a partial reversal or reversal upto the amount originally transferred.\n\nYou can reverse fund transfers even after they have been settled to a linked\naccount, as long as there is a floating balance available in the linked\naccount.\n\nFor all refund requests made by the end customer, the funds transfer takes place\nfrom your primary account. Therefore, as a merchant, you need to initiate a reversal\nof funds from your linked accounts and also initiate the\nrefund to the customer. You have the flexibility to perform refunds and\nreversals independently.\n\nAdditionally, Razorpay provides an automated method of reversing funds before a\nrefund. On enabling the Reverse All option on a payment refund request, we will\nfirst automatically reverse all transfers made on the payment, before refunding\nthe payment to the customer.\n\n@image route_reversals.svg\n\nScheduling Settlements\n\nYou can assign a settlement cycle for your linked accounts and update it\nanytime. By default, every new linked account is created with the same\nsettlement schedule assigned to your main account. For Example - If your\nmain Razorpay account has a T+3 schedule, all linked accounts you create\nwill also have a T+3 schedule by default.\n\nNote: At the moment, linked account settlement schedules can be assigned or\nupdated by reaching out to us at https://razorpay.com/support.\nThe API for this will be made available shortly.\n\nSettlement schedules for linked accounts may only be set to a minimum of the\nschedule assigned to merchant's account.\n\nIn addition to the account-level schedule explained above, you can also define\nwhen each individual transfer should be settled by making use of the two\nfollowing options:\n\nOn hold\nBy default, all transfers will be settled according to the settlement schedule\ndefined for the linked account. You can choose defer settlements for a transfer\nindefinitely. Settlement for the transfer will only be initiated once you allow\nit.\n\nOn hold until\nYou can set a time until which the settlement for the transfer should defer.\nOnce this time has elapsed, Razorpay will settle the funds to the linked account\non the next business day. For example, if you had sent us a onholduntil\ntimestamp corresponding to 7:00 PM on 23/03/2017, we will settle the amount to the\nlinked account on 24/03/2017.\n\nYou can modify the above mentioned transfer settlement options via the API or\nDashboard. On enabling the settlement, the originally defined settlement\nschedule will apply.\n\nFor example, on a T+3 cycle -\nIf a transfer was created with settle = false and set to true after 10 days,\nthe settlement for that transfer will happen immediately (during bank business\nhours).\nIf the transfer settlement was allowed on T+1 though, the settlement will\nhappen only on T+3.\n","url":"route/operations"},{"title":"Other Features","body":"\nLinked Account API Access\nYou can access the various Razorpay APIs as a linked account.

Please do not share this with anyone.\n\nPCI Compliance:\nTo enable support for a server-to-server integration on your account, a PCI compliance certificate is mandatory. This certificate needs to be submitted and updated as per the yearly renewal cycle.\n\nYou can integrate Razorpay in your web application in three steps:\nCreating an order.\nCreating a payment.\nVerifying the payment.\n\n1. Creating an Order\n\nCreating an order is the first step to integrate Razorpay payments in your web application. Orders API allows you to create an order when a payment is expected from a customer.\n\nOn the frontend, this can be invoked by an on-click event allows customers to proceed to Checkout. The orders API returns razorpayorderid which will be consumed for signature verfication after the payment is authorized.\n\nMake sure you store the razorpayorderid against the corresponding transaction. The below API endpoint will create an order at your server-side:\n\n/orders\n\nNote:\nFor authentication, you need to provide your key and secret in the basic auth header as username. For example, https://rzptestKEYID:RZPKEY_SECRET@api.razorpay.com/v1/orders. Refer the the wikipedia page to correctly implement it at your end.\n\nA sample cURL request for creating an order is shown below:\n\ncurl -u rzptest26ccbdbfe0e84b:69b2e24411e384f91213f22a \\\n    https://api.razorpay.com/v1/orders\n    -X POST \\\n    --data \"amount=50000\" \\\n    --data \"currency=INR\" \\\n    --data \"receipt=Receipt #RCPTID43\" \\\n    --data \"payment_capture=1\"\n    https://api.razorpay.com/v1/orders\ntry {\n  JSONObject orderRequest = new JSONObject();\n  // amount in paise\n  orderRequest.put(\"amount\", 50000);\n  orderRequest.put(\"currency\", \"INR\");\n  orderRequest.put(\"receipt\", \"RCPTID43\");\n  orderRequest.put(\"payment_capture\", true);\n\n  Order order = razorpay.Orders.create(orderRequest);\n} catch (RazorpayException e) {\n  // Handle Exception\n  System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n}\norder_amount = 50000\norder_currency = 'INR'\norder_receipt = 'RCPTID43'\nnotes = {'details': 'A Wild Sheep Chase is the third novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami'}   # OPTIONAL\n\nclient.order.create(amount=50000, currency=INR, receipt=RCPTID43, notes=A Wild Sheep Chase is the third novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami, payment_capture='1')\n$order  = $client->order->create([\n  'receipt'         => 'RCPTID43',\n  // amount in paise\n  'amount'          => 50000,\n  'currency'        => 'INR',\n  'payment_capture' =>  '1'\n]);\nDictionary options = new Dictionary();\n// amount in paise\noptions.Add(\"amount\", 50000);\noptions.add(\"receipt\", \"RCPTID43\");\noptions.add(\"currency\", \"INR\");\noptions.add(\"payment_capture\", \"1\");\nOrder order = client.Order.Create(options);\noptions = amount: 50000, currency: 'INR', receipt: 'RCPTID43', payment_capture: '1'\norder = Razorpay::Order.create\nvar options = {\n  // amount in pase\n  amount: 50000,\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  receipt: \"RCPTID43\",\n  payment_capture: '1'\n};\ninstance.orders.create(options, function(err, order) {\n  console.log(order);\n});\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"order_4xbQrmEoA5WJ0G\",\n  \"entity\": \"order\",\n  \"amount\": 50000,\n  \"currency\": \"INR\",\n  \"receipt\": \"Receipt RCPTID43\",\n  \"status\": \"created\",\n  \"attempts\": 0,\n  \"created_at\": 1455696638,\n  \"notes\": {}\n}\n\nRefer the Orders API Reference section to learn more about orders.\n\n2. Creating a Payment\n\nOnce an order is created, your next step is to create a payment. The following API will create a payment:\n\n/payments/create/redirect\n\nThe following fields can be passed:\n\ncurrency\n: INR Default and the only supported currency value.\n\namount\n: Integer value in paisa. For example, for ₹20, amount should be 2000.\n\nemail\n: example: gaurav.kumar@razorpay.com\n\norder_id\n: The unique identifier of the order created using Razorpay Orders API. Sample order ID will have the following format: order_9A33XWu170gUtm\n\ncontact\n: example: 9123456789, +18002700323\n\nmethod\n: one of card netbanking wallet emi upi\n\nvpa\n: Virtual Payment Address of the customer. Required if method = upi. You can use failure@razorpay in test mode to simulate the failure cases.\n\ncard[number]\n: Unformatted card number. Required if value of method field is card. Use our test card - 4242424242424242.\n\ncard[name]\n: Cardholder's name.\n\ncard[expiry_month]\n: Expiry month for card in MM format. January starts from 01.\n\ncard[expiry_year]\n: Expiry year for card in YY format.\n\ncard[cvv]\n: CVV printed on back side of card\n\nbank\n: Required bank code if value of method field is netbanking. For example, SBIN for SBI Bank. You could fetch bank codes using a GET API as shown below: https://@api.razorpay.com/v1/methods\n\nwallet\n: Required wallet code if value of method field is wallet. For example, mobikwik\n\nnotes\n: Optional key-value pair represented as JSON object.\n\ncallback_url\n: Mandatory URL, where we will submit the final payment status.\n\nip\n: Client IP Address. Mandatory.\n\nreferer\n: Client referrer. Mandatory.\n\nuser_agent\n: Client User-agent. Mandatory.\n\nSend the data as form-urlencoded format, which will ensure that nested keys are correctly passed.\n\nResponses\n\nThe following are the types of possible responses for a create payment request:\n\n200 Success\n\nThis can happen only in the case of international cards, where there is no two-factor authentication. Use 555555555555558 as the card number to test this flow.\nWhen a payment is successful, we will return 200 OK success response along with the following fields:\n\n  razorpaypaymentid\n  razorpayorderid\n  razorpay_signature\n\nNote:\nIf International cards are disabled for your account, you will get an immediate error response for the entered card number, which should be handled as done for Validation Errors.\n\n302 Redirect\n\nIn the case of a 302 Redirect response, you can fetch the target URL from the header location which can be used to redirect your customers. This occurs when we need to redirect to bank/wallet page via a GET request. You can test this flow using the following test card number - 4111111111111111\n\nHTML Form Post\n\nIn this case, the response will be an HTML content that needs to be opened in the customer's browser. This HTML content contains a bunch of form-fields which will be automatically posted to the bank/wallet URL (specified in the form) to continue with the payment process.\nThis case occurs when you need to redirect users to the bank/wallet page via a POST request. You can test this flow using the following test card number - 4012001037141112\n\nValidation Error\n\nFor validation errors such as invalid card number and incorrect currency, we will send an error response. Refer the error codes and their description.\n\nIf a redirection was involved (in the Redirect/HTML Form post case), then as final result of the payment process, we will make a POST request on the callback_url specified originally during payment creation.\n\nFor successful payments, the POST parameter will be razorpaypaymentid. In case of errors, the POST parameters will be an error dictionary containing the following fields:\n\n  code\n  description\n  field\n\nNote: If the response is missing the razorpaypaymentid field, the POST parameters will be an error dictionary containing the following fields:\n  code\n  description\n  field\n\nFor eg, if you send a wrong card number, we'll immedaitely return a 400 error with the following response:\n\n{\n  \"error\": {\n  \"code\": \"BADREQUESTERROR\"\n  }\n}\n\n3. Verifying the Payment\n\nOnce the payment process completes, you will receive a POST request at callback_url.

RAZORPXY.\n\nDescriptor\n\nThe descriptor field can be used to define the last eight characters of the generated bank account number.\n\n{\n  \"receiver\": {\n    \"types\": [\n      \"bank_account\"\n    ],\n    \"bank_account\": {\n      \"descriptor\": \"00000001\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"customerid\": \"cust805c8oBQdBGPwS\",\n  \"description\": \"Custom Virtual Account\"\n}\n{\n  \"id\": \"va_4xbQrmEoA5WJ0G\",\n  \"entity\": \"virtual_account\",\n  \"description\": \"Custom Virtual Account\",\n  \"customerid\": \"cust805c8oBQdBGPwS\",\n  \"status\": \"active\",\n  \"amount_paid\": 0,\n  \"receivers\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"ba_4lsdkfldlteskf\",\n      \"entity\": \"bank_account\",\n      \"name\": \"Merchant Billing Label\",\n      \"account_number\": \"2223334400000001\",\n      \"ifsc\": \"RAZR0000001\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created_at\": 1455696638\n}\n\nHere in this example, a descriptor 00000001 is being used to generate an account number, while prefix 22233344 is pre-decided.\n\nDescriptor Usage\n\nThe descriptor can have a maximum length of upto 8 characters. This is because some banks do not allow addition of beneficiary accounts that have an account number longer than 16 characters.\n\nThis descriptor field can only be used if custom virtual accounts are enabled for your account. If it is not set, sending any value in the descriptor field will return an error.\n\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"description\": \"Descriptor cannot be used with your account.\",\n    \"code\": \"BADREQUESTERROR\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe descriptor is required to be unique amongst your active virtual accounts. If a descriptor is sent, which is already in use by another active virtual account, the following error is returned.\n\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"description\": \"An active virtual account with the same descriptor already exists for your account.\",\n    \"code\": \"BADREQUESTERROR\"\n  }\n}\n\nAvoiding Ambiguous Account Numbers\n\nWhen displaying a bank account number to a customer, the font used may cause the customer to misread the alphanumeric characters (if any) in the number. This means customers are very liable to committing typos when required to enter the beneficiary account while initiating a payment. Misreading the letter 'O' in an account number as the numeral '0', for example, is extremely common.\n\nPayments made to such mistyped accounts are considered invalid, and are refunded back to the customer's account within 1 working day. However, this is still a huge inconvenience for the customer, who now has to wait 24 hours to receive a refund for what is often a rather large payment.\n\nFor this reason, we strongly advice against using the following characters in your descriptor for alphanumeric accounts, as they may appear ambiguous in certain fonts.\n\n0 or O\n1 or I\n5 or S\n8 or B\n2 or Z\n","url":"smart-collect/custom"},{"title":"Razorpay Smart Collect","desc":"With Razorpay Smartcollect you can create virtual accounts for customers to pay via NEFT, RTGS, IMPS. Find use cases, advantages, lifecycle & FAQ here.","body":"\nIntroduction\nRazorpay Smart Collect allows you to accept payments made via a variety of online and offline methods.\n\nUsing Razorpay Smart Collect, you can create any number of virtual accounts for your customers for transferring funds (via NEFT, RTGS, IMPS, etc.) to an account linked directly to your bank account.\nA new account can be created for each customer, allowing you to easily track payments made by them, as Razorpay will notify you of each payment made to any of your accounts.\nRazorpay automatically handles the complexity of reconciling these payments on\nyour behalf.\n\nNote: Payments made using Smart Collect largely follow Razorpay’s existing payment flow. If you are new to Razorpay, we recommend understanding this before you go ahead with the rest of the document.\n\nUse Cases\n\nHere are some examples of how Smart Collect can be leveraged.\n\nOne Time Payment\nIf you need to accept a single, large payment from a customer, preferably via NEFT/RTGS/IMPS, you can create a virtual account using Smart Collect for them and share the generated account number and IFSC code. When the customer makes the payment to this account, you will be notified by Razorpay, and can then close the account.\n\nRegular Payments\nIf you need to send a customer regular invoices for payments of large volume, you can create a virtual account using Smart Collect for them and share the details. The customer can add this account as a beneficiary on his preferred banking portal, and make regular payments to it whenever required. Razorpay will notify you for every payment made towards the account, thus simplifying the reconciliation process.\n\nEvent-Based Payments\nIf you need to accept several payments from multiple sources, for a range of possible campaigns/events, you can use Smart Collect to create a virtual account for each campaign, and share details accordingly. For every payment made towards any of these accounts, Razorpay will notify you of the account that was used, thus eliminating the need to identify which campaign the payment was made for.\n\nAdvantages\nSharing your actual account number for purposes of receiving a NEFT/RTGS/IMPS transaction has several disadvantages, most notably that of reconciliation. This is an arduous task, involving matching the bank reference IDs shared by the customers with those present in your bank statement.\n\nHowever, with Smart Collect you can create a unique bank account number for each customer, and automatically tag the payments made to each account with the customer it was created for. This greatly simplifies the reconciliation process.\n\nUsing Smart Collect thus entails a reduction in administration cost, as it can be used to identify remitters automatically and not depend on the bank reference details provided in the payment reference field.\n\nLifecycle\nA virtual account made in this fashion will remain open, i.e. they will have status active, until explicitly closed. See Statuses and API Endpoints for more details.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow can a customer make a payment to a Smart Collect Virtual Account?\nThe customer can make a transaction to the account via a simple NEFT/RTGS/IMPS transaction from his preferred Netbanking portal.\n\nWhat does a Smart Collect Virtual Account look like?\nExactly like a normal account! Here's an example:\n\nAccount Number: 11122219877893452\nIFSC: RAZR0000001\nName: Merchant Billing Label\n\nWhat name will be associated with a Smart Collect Virtual Account?\nYour merchant billing label will be used as the name on your Virtual Account.\n","url":"smart-collect"},{"title":"Notification","desc":"Recieve notifications for your Razorpay virtual account for payment captured event using webhooks and receive email notifications for payment successful event.","body":"\nAll payments made using Smart Collect will show up on your merchant dashboard as well as in the usual payment response APIs, as payments made with method bank_transfer.\n\nWebhooks\nPayments made using this method will also trigger webhooks much like regular payments.

Refunds are generally processed within 3-5 business days. The transaction fee and GST charged on successful transactions will not be reversed in case of refunds.\n\n  IMPS Refunds\n\n  Refunds are handled internally by Razorpay by triggering a new transfer towards the customer's bank account. These appear in the customer's account statement as an independent transaction (rather than an explicit reversal of the original payment).\n  A small number of banks do not share the payer's account number while initiating an IMPS payment. For these cases, it is not possible to refund the payment.\n\n  Additionally, refunds will also fail if the payment was originally made from an Non-Resident External (NRE) bank account, as Razorpay is not permitted to deposit money into such accounts.\n\nNotification\nYou will be notified of any payments made to your QR Code via webhook and email. See Notifications for more details.\n\nAny payment made towards this QR Code by the customer will thus reflect on your dashboard as payment made using receiver “qr_code”.\n\nYou can view the funds received by a QR Code using the “amount_paid” field in the virtual account entity.

That is, if the subscription is being cancelled at cycle end, the subscription's status will move to cancelled at the end of the cycle. Webhook will also be fired at the end of the cycle.If the subscription was created with customer_notify as 1, then a cancellation email will be sent to the customer when we receive a cancellation request from you, irrespective of immediate or future.\n\nAdd-on\n\nYou can create add-ons to charge an extra amount for a particular billing cycle.\nOnce you create an addon, it gets attached to the next invoice that gets generated for the given subscription.

Create a Plan\nStep 2. Create a Subscription\nStep 3. Create an Authentication Transaction (auth transaction)\n\n Note: Creating a customer is not required at any point in the subscription creation flow. Once the auth transaction has been completed by a customer, we create a new customer with the customer details and associate that to the subscription.\n\n@image subsflowgeneral.png\n\nCreating a Plan\n\nThe first step to creating a subscription is to create a plan. A plan contains product details along with the amount and frequency of the billing cycles. Depending upon your business, you can create multiple plans with different billing cycles and pricing.\n\nFor example, you can create a Basic Plan that includes some of the regular services you provide for say, @data.Rs 200 per month and a Premium Plan that includes some additional services that you can price it at, say @data.Rs 300 per month.\n\nWhile creating a plan, you need to define the following details:\n\nAmount\n: Amount being charged for the plan.\n\nPeriod\n: This can be either daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.\n\nInterval\n: Clubbed with period, this defines how often the customer should be charged.\n\nFor example:\n\nAmount: @data.Rs 200, Period: weekly, Interval: 3\n: Charge @data.Rs 200, every 3 weeks.\n\nAmount: @data.Rs 1000, Period: monthly, Interval: 2\n: Charge @data.Rs 1000, every 2 months.\n\nAmount: @data.Rs 50, Period: daily, Interval: 10\n: Charge @data.Rs 50, every 10 days.\n\n Note: Plans with daily period must have interval set to an value greater than 7.\n\n Note: Plans are like templates and can be reused. If you have only a few plans you can create them via the Dashboard. However, if your business has custom plans for every customer, you can create plans via the API.\n\nTo create a plan via the API, refer the API Reference page.\n\nTo create a plan from the Dashboard:\n\nLog in to Razorpay Dashboard.\nGo to Subscriptions.\nClick the Plans tab.\nClick New Plan and enter the following details:\n    Plan Name\n    Plan Description. This field is optional.\n    Billing Frequency. You can set billing cycle (start date and end date) and trial period later while, creating a subscription as well.\n    Billing Amount. This is considered per unit.\n    Internal Notes, if any.\nClick Create Plan.\n\nThe filled-in Plan creation page appears as shown below:\n@image creating-plan-new-final.png\n\nCreating a Subscription\nThe next step is creating a subscription using the plan you created in Step 1. You have to define the following details when creating a subscription:\n\nPlan ID\n: ID of the plan to which a customer wants to subscribe to on your website.\n\nStart at\n: Date and time at which the subscription would start.\n If this field is not passed, the subscription would start immediately. The first auth transaction will include the plan amount instead of a token amount of 5rs. More details on this provided in the next section.\n If this field is passed, the subscription would start at the time specified. This can be used to provide trial periods to your customers.\n\nTotal count\n: This defines how long the subscription should run for. Currently, the maximum time that a subscription is allowed to run without requiring an authentication again from the customer is 10 years. Please note that we do not support lifetime subscription as of now.\n For example, if a customer is subscribing to a monthly plan on March 1st, 2017 for 2 years, the total count would be 24. The subscription would automatically move into completed state on March 1st 2019.\n\nQuantity\n: This defines the number of units of the subscription. A B2B company can use this field to define the number of users that the company wants to subscribe a particular plan for. This is an optional field and the default value for this is 1.\n\nAddons\n: Addons can be used to collect an upfront amount from the customer at the time of auth transaction.\n If a subscription is created with addons input, the customer will be charged an extra amount during the auth transaction.\n For example, if you want to charge a delivery fees or installation charges or setup fees, you can pass this as part of subscription creation API. In the auth transaction, we will collect the addon amount instead of the token amount of 5rs. More details around this provided in the next section.\n\nCurrently, you can create a subscription via the API only. Refer the API Reference page for more details.\n\nAuthentication Transaction\n\nAfter you create a subscription, permission to charge the customer's card at periodic intervals is required. For this, an authentication transaction (auth transaction) is carried out.\n\nThe auth transaction can be collected from the customer by passing subscription_id in the checkout options, while instantiating the checkout. To collect the payments from customers using our checkout, pass the following options to checkout.js in the script tag given below:\n\nPay\n\nvar options = {\n    \"key\": \"YOURKEYID\",\n    \"subscriptionid\": \"sub8hYZKdAUDOpOXz\",\n    \"name\": \"Merchant Name\",\n    \"description\": \"Purchase Description\",\n    \"image\": \"/your_logo.png\",\n    \"handler\": function (response){\n        alert(response.razorpaypaymentid);\n    },\n    \"prefill\": {\n        \"name\": \"Customer Name\",\n        \"email\": \"test@email.com\"\n    },\n    \"notes\": {\n        \"address\": \"Hello World\"\n    },\n    \"theme\": {\n        \"color\": \"#F37254\"\n    }\n};\nvar rzp1 = new Razorpay(options);\n\ndocument.getElementById('rzp-button1').onclick = function(e){\n    rzp1.open();\n    e.preventDefault();\n}\n\nThe checkout options are similar to the normal payment. The only difference is that subscription_id has to be passed in the options, along with the other options. The complete list of options can be found here.\n\nAlso please note that you do not have to pass any order_id to the checkout options. You do not have to use the orders API while using subscriptions.\n\nNote: The auth transaction is an important and mandatory step to charge the customer automatically on a recurring basis.\nAs part of the auth transaction, we also create a customer using the customer details entered on the checkout and associate it with the subscription\n\nPayment Verification\n\nAfter the auth transaction has been successfully completed, Checkout will return the following data in the response:\nrazorpaypaymentid\nrazorpaysubscriptionid\nrazorpay_signature\n\nThe razorpaysignature received here needs to be verified on your backend server. In order to verify the signature, you need to fetch the subscriptionid from your database (not the one from the checkout response) and use your API Secret to generate the signature.\n\nTo generate the signature, calculate an HMAC hex digest using SHA256 algorithm and these fields. The razorpaypaymentid and subscription_id fields are concatenated using the | (pipe) symbol.\n\n$expectedSignature = hash_hmac(self::SHA256, $razorpayPaymentId . '|' . $subscriptionId, $secret);\n\nif ($expectedSignature === $razorpaySignature)\n{\n    echo \"Payment is successful!\";\n}\n\nNote: You should only consider the payment as successful and subscription as authenticated after the signature has been successfully verified,\n\nAuth Transaction Amount\n\nThe auth transaction amount is the very first amount you charge on the customer's card. Based on your business need, you can decide on what should be the auth transaction amount. If you are going to collect subscription charges at a later time, the auth transaction will be made of @data.Rs 5 (token amount) which gets auto-refunded. Otherwise, you can create an auth transaction with any of the following first transaction amounts as well:\n\nUpfront amount\n: If you pass the addons key while creating the subscription, the addon amount will be collected from the customer during the auth transaction. The addon can be used as a security deposit or delivery fees.\n\nImmediate start\n: If you do not pass the start_at key while creating the subscription, the subscription starts immediately. The amount used for the auth transaction here would be the plan amount. If you do pass the start at value, then the automated charges on the subscription will start on the specified time.\n\nUpfront amount + immediate\n: If you pass addons key while creating the subscription AND you want the subscription to start immediately (by not passing start_at key while creating subscription), then the amount charged in the auth transaction will be addon amount + plan amount.\n\n Note: In the above three cases, the auth transaction amount would not be refunded. An invoice will also be generated if any of the above three cases are satisfied.\n\nPossible Scenarios\n\nIn the following table, various scenarios of creating an auth transactions are listed based on the Upfront Amount you might collect in the beginning and the Start At date which defines if you are collecting subscription charges immediately or later.\n\nScenario\nUpfront Amount (addon)\nStart At\nAuth Transaction Amount\n\nScenario 1: When the subscription fees is charged immediately without an upfront amount.\nAbsent\nImmediate\nAuth Transaction Amount = Plan amount (subscription charge)  For example, a merchant has a weekly magazine plan of @data.Rs 150 and a customer subscribes to this plan and wants the subscription to start immediately. Here, as part of the auth transaction itself, we'll be charging the first charge of the subscription (@data.Rs 150). The second charge and the subsequent charges will be auto-charged on the card in the coming weeks as per the schedule defined.\n\nScenario 2: When the subscription fee is charged immediately with an upfront amount.\nPresent\nImmediate\nAuth Transaction Amount = Upfront amount + Subscription Charge.  For example, a merchant has a image editing software which can be used by customers by subscribing to different plans. The monthly plan costs @data.Rs 2500. The merchant also provides priority support for an additional cost (upfront amount) of @data.Rs 500. A customer subscribing to the monthly plan and opting for priority support would be making an auth transaction of @data.Rs 2500 + @data.Rs 500 = @data.Rs 3000. The second charge and the subsequent charges of @data.Rs 2500 will be auto-charged on the card in the coming months.\n\nScenario 3: When the subscription amount is charged in the future without an upfront amount.\nAbsent\nFuture\nAuth transaction amount of @data.Rs 5 is automatically created. The amount is auto-refunded immediately.  For example, a merchant that provides online source of e-books provides 1 month trial before charging the subscription fees of @data.Rs 250 per month. Since the subscription charges will be collected from the following month, an auth transaction amount of @data.Rs 5 is created and auto-refunded.\n\nScenario 4: When the subscription amount is charged in the future with an upfront amount.\nPresent\nFuture\nAuth Transaction Amount = Upfront Amount.  For example, a merchant charges @data.Rs 5000 as upfront amount and @data.Rs 2500 as monthly charges for renting a dining table set. The merchant requires a few days to deliver this product. Customer subscribes to this plan for which he needs to pay an upfront amount of @data.Rs 5000. This amount is used as the auth transaction amount. Once the dining table set has been delivered, the customer will start getting charged an amount of @data.Rs 2500 on a recurring basis.  Please note that the start_at value should be set to the delivery date while creating the subscription.\n\nWhen all the three steps mentioned above are completed, the subscription workflow is handled end-to-end by us without any intervention required from your side.\n\n Note: Only when the state changes to halted or completed, action is required from you or the customer. Refer the table on State change to know about how you can handle this.\n\nAdditional Functionalities\n\nYou can create your subscription with a trial period or an upfront amount. You can also cancel a subscription or handle retries. You can see how these can be done in our Manage your Subscriptions section.\n\nNote: Since most subscription activity happens automatically, you can enable webhooks to get notified of the events.\n","url":"subscriptions/create"},{"title":"Handling Payment Retries","desc":"Handle Razorpay payment retries when auto-charge fails.

On a successful charge, the\nfollowing webhooks will be triggered:\n subscription.charged webhook\n subscription.activated webhook\n\n Subscription will be moved from halted state to activated state.\n\nIf there are previous incomplete charges, they will have to be re-attempted via\nthe Dashboard manually.\n\nRetries\nThe auto-debit of the periodic charges takes place on the scheduled day as defined by you. However, due to unforeseen reasons such as card expiry, card blocking by bank, insufficient balance, and so on, the scheduled recurring payment could fail.\n\nHandling Retries\nIn such failure scenarios, Razorpay will ensure that a retry is initiated on the next day. You will be notified about the failed attempt via our webhooks and we will automatically process a retry without you having to take any action.\n\nA retry normally takes place in T+3 days cycle three times, i.e., once every day for 3 days, excluding the date of charge. If, even with the retries the payment fails, the subscription is moved to halted state. To know about the different Subscriptions' states, refer Subscription Lifecycle page.\n\nThe retry model works in the following manner:\n\nLet T=0 be the day when the charge was to be made.\nOn T=0 we will attempt to charge the card.\nIf it fails, the subscription's state will be changed to pending and we will attempt again on T+1.\nIf it fails again, we will attempt two more times on T+2 and T+3 respectively.\nIf the charge still fails, the subscription’s state will be changed to halted.\n\nWith the webhooks subscription.pending and subscription.halted enabled, you would receive a notification every time a subscription moves into one of these states. You could then decide to hold off the delivery of the service as per your business model. Razorpay would also send an email to the customer notifying about the failure. This email would contain a link through which the customer can change the card which is associated with the subscription.\nIf the customer changes the card while the subscription is in pending state, we would automatically attempt to charge the last invoice. If this charge is successful, the subscription will move to active state.\nIf the customer changes the card while the subscription is in halted state, no invoice is charged and the subscription just moves to active state, if the card change was successful.\n\nThe invoices for a subscription are created even when the subscription's state is halted. But, these invoices will not be charged by us. They can be charged manually by you from the Dashboard.\n\nMore information around subscription webhooks can be found here.\n","url":"subscriptions/handling-retries"},{"title":"Hosted Solution","desc":"Use our ready-to-use hosted page that sends emails to customers to handle Razorpay payment failures when an auto-charge on a subscription is attempted.","body":"\nLanding Page\n\nYou can make use of our ready-made hosted page solution to handle payment failures when an auto-charge is attempted.

Recurring payments are payments that:\n\nYou can charge as per a fixed schedule\nDo not require any intervention on the customer’s end as it is automated.\n\nUsing Razorpay Subscriptions you can automatically charge customers based on a billing cycle that you control. You can easily create and manage recurring payments and get instant alerts on payment activity as well as the status of subscriptions. Razorpay handles all the complexities of managing recurring payments on your behalf.\n\nNote: The Subscriptions platform is based on Razorpay’s existing\npayment flow. If you are new to\nRazorpay, we recommend you to understand this flow before you read further.\n\nGetting Started\n\nWith Razorpay Subscriptions, you can bill customers periodically in the following simple steps:\n\nDefine a plan that sets what amount should be billed and how often.\nCreate a subscription for the selected plan with the start and end details.\nCreate an authentication transaction (auth transaction). The auth transaction is an approval process that grants permission to charge the customer's card on a periodic basis. This is an important and mandatory step while creating a subscription.\n\nThe entire flow of creating a subscription is described in the section Creating Subscriptions.\n\n Note: You need not create a customer to create a subscription. When the auth transaction is completed by a customer, we automatically create a new customer with the customer details and associate it with the subscription.\n\nSubscriptions Payment Flow\n\nThe payment flow in subscriptions takes place in the following way:\n\nMerchant creates different plans for their products/services.\nCustomer selects the plan from the merchant site.\nOnce the customer selects a plan from the merchant's website, a subscription on Razorpay is created and the subscription_id received in the response, is passed on to the Razorpay Checkout via the checkout options.\nOn the Checkout form, the customer enters the card details and clicks Pay.\nThis forms an auth transaction and on a successful payment, a customer is created and linked to the subscription!\nAutomated charges on the subscription are now made as per the schedule defined by the plan.\n\nHow Recurring Payments Work\n\nRecurring payments do not require any intervention at the customer’s end. It is an automated payment collection system that requires one-time approval from the customer via the auth transaction. Following points summarizes recurring payments:\n\nCustomer’s approval is sought before recurring payments are collected. This approval process works just like normal payments with the 3D Secure authentication step. This is what we refer to as authentication transaction or simply 'auth transaction'.\nOnce the auth transaction has been successfully completed, the card is charged automatically at the start of every billing cycle.\nFor every recurring payment, an invoice is generated which includes customer and subscription details along with your branding.\n\nTerms Used\n\nPlan\n: A plan allows you to define what should be billed, for what price and when.\nFor example, you could define a plan for a particular service or a product, that is to be charged ₹1000 monthly or another product/service to be charged ₹12,000 yearly. You can define multiple plans and call it Basic, Intermediate, Pro and so on. Plans can be created via the Razorpay Dashboard as well as through APIs.\n\nSubscription\n: A subscription is created from a plan, customized for each customer. Subscription also defines the date at which the subscription should start and how long is the subscription for. You can also create subscriptions with trial period.\n\nAuth Transaction\n: The auth transaction is a 3D secure authentication step before recurring payments are charged on your customer's card. It is an approval process from the customer who is subscribing to a plan and also a way to validate a card to which a subscription would be charged on a periodic basis. The auth transaction is an RBI mandate for all recurring payments in India.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow do recurring payments on Credit Cards work in India?\nRecurring payments are allowed on MasterCard and Visa network credit cards provided the customer authorizes the first transaction through a normal Two-Factor Authentication/3DSecure flow.\n\nHow do recurring payments on Debit Cards work in India?\nRecurring payments are allowed on Mastercard and Visa network cards issued by ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Citibank and Canara Bank, provided the customer authorizes the first transaction through a normal Two-Factor Authentication/3DSecure flow.\n\nHow does the two-factor authentication (2FA) work with recurring payments?\nThe first transaction needs to go through the 2FA process. Further charges can be made automatically, without 2FA.\n\nWhich payment instruments support recurring payments?\nCredit cards on MasterCard and Visa network issued by any bank in India. Debit cards on Mastercard and Visa network issued by ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Citibank and Canara Bank.\n\nOne of my customers received this SMS from bank.\nYour trx is debited to xxxx Bank CREDIT Card for Rs. xx.xx. This is not an authenticated trx as per RBI Mandate effective 1 May 12.\nSome customers may receive such messages from the bank for subscription transactions. However, no need to worry about it as this communication is for information only. We assure you that all transactions on Razorpay are authorised as per RBI compliance.\n\nHow to edit a plan or subscription?\nCurrently, editing a plan or subscription is not available.","url":"subscriptions"},{"title":"Lifecycle","desc":"Razorpay Subscription Lifecycle involves subscription states such as created, authenticated, active, pending, halted, cancelled, expired, and completed.","body":"\nOnce you create a subscription, you will be able to track it as it goes through various stages. While a simple lifecycle for a subscription includes creation, authentication, active and then completion; you also have the option to cancel a subscription that you create.\nUnderstanding what happens in the natural course of a subscription helps provide the smoothest experience for both you and your users.\nA detailed explanation of each of the stages is given below.\n\nThe stages that a subscription is likely to go through are illustrated here:\n\n@image subs-cycle_1.png\n\nSubscription States\n\nCreated\n: This is the initial state of the subscription after it is created.\n\nAuthenticated\n: A subscription goes to the authenticated state when the credit card is authenticated by the customer, that is, the auth transaction has been completed. It moves to active state right before the first charge attempt is made on the subscription.\n\nActive\n: A subscription goes to the active state when the billing cycle for the subscription starts.\n\nPending\n: A subscription goes to the pending state when the last auto-charge becomes unsuccessful and we are currently retrying the payment. The merchant can, in the meanwhile, ask the customer to change the card, if required. After all the retry attempts have been exhausted, the subscription moves to halted state.\n\nHalted\n: The subscription goes to halted state when the last auto-charge becomes unsuccessful and the retries are also exhausted. Invoices continue to be created in halted state for the future billing cycles, but will not be charged. The subscription can move to active state if the customer changes their card and we are able to perform a charge on it successfully. It can also be moved to active if a charge on an older invoice is attempted and it goes through successfully. This can be done from the Dashboard. Once the subscription moves into the active state, the previous charges are not re-attempted. They will have to be re-attempted via the Dashboard manually, if required. Only the future billing cycles are charged automatically after the subscription moves to active state.\n\nCancelled\n: A subscription moves to cancelled state when the cancel API for the subscription is called or is marked as cancelled from the Dashboard. A subscription in the cancelled state cannot be restarted again.\n\nExpired\n: If the startat for the subscription has been set and the auth transaction has not been done by the startat time, the subscription moves to expired state and cannot be used again.\n\nCompleted\n: A subscription moves to completed state when it reaches the end of its lifecyle, as per the end_date set for the subscription.\n\nSubscription State Changes\n\nThe following table explains how we assist you as the subscription moves from one state to another. It highlights a few parameters and explains what this change means. It also explains what you can do during this change.\n\nCreated\n: → Authenticated\nThis indicates that the auth transaction has been completed. If you are giving a trial period to the customer, this will be the state of the subscription until the trial period ends. After which, it will move to active state.\n\n→ Expired\nThis is valid only if a startat has been provided to the subscription. This indicates that the auth transaction was not completed before the startat time and hence the subscription moved to expired state. This is a terminal state and no further actions can be taken.\n\n→ Cancelled\n This indicates the subscription has been cancelled by the merchant even before completing the auth transaction. This is a terminal state and no further actions can be taken.\n\nAuthenticated\n: → Active\nThis indicates that the invoice for the first change has been created and an attempt to charge the authorized card against the invoice amount will be made.\n  Action on Razorpay: We will attempt to charge the authorized card against the invoice amount.\n→ Cancelled\nThis indicates that the subscription has been cancelled either by customer/merchant before initiating the first charge. This could have also been initiated during the trial period. Once the subscription has been marked as cancelled, no further action can be taken on it.\n\nActive\n: → Pending\nThis indicates that the last auto-charge was unsuccessful.\nWe will ensure that a retry is initiated on the next day.\n  Action on Razorpay: You will be notified about the failed attempt via our webhooks and we will automatically process a retry without you having to take any action. We will also send the customer an email notifying about this failure. This email will also have a call-to-action from the customer for changing their card which is associated with the subscription.\n\n→ Completed\nThis indicates that the subscription has successfully reached the end of its life cycle, as per the end_date set for the subscription. This is a terminal state and no further actions can be taken.\n\n→ Cancelled\nThis indicates that the subscription has been cancelled either by the customer or the merchant during the lifecycle of a subscription. This is a terminal state and no further action can be taken.\n\nPending\n: → Halted\n This indicates the last auto-charge was unsuccessful and all the retries have been exhausted.\n  Action on Razorpay: Invoices will continue to be created for the subsequent billing periods, but will not attempt a charge. It is important to note that once the subscription moves into active state, the previous charges will not be re-attempted and only future billing cycles will be charged automatically.\n Action on merchant/customer: To move the subscription back to active state, the customer will need to change the card which will enable us to perform a charge on it successfully. The customer/merchant can also manually attempt a charge on the same card by attempting to charge any of the older unpaid invoices and it should go through successfully.\n\n→ Cancelled\nThis indicates that the subscription has been cancelled either by the customer or merchant during the lifecycle of a subscription. Since this is a terminal state, no further action can be taken.\n\n→ Active → Completed\nThis can happen during the last billing cycle of a subscription. This indicates the attempt for the last auto-charge has failed but the retry has been successful. Hence, the subscription will move from pending, active and finally to completed - marking the end of subscription. This is a terminal state.\n  Action on Razorpay: We will be firing the following webhooks: subscription.charged, subscription.active and subscription.completed.\n\n→ Halted → Completed\nThis can happen during the last billing cycle of the subscription. This indicates that all the auto-charge attempts of the last invoice has failed, the subscription is moved to halted state and then to completed state. This is a terminal state.\n  Action on Razorpay: We will be firing the following webhooks: subscription.halted, subscription.completed.\n\nHalted\n: → Active\n A subscription will move from halted to active state when: 1. A customer changes the card and performs a charge successfully. 2. The merchant/customer manually attempts a charge on an older unpaid invoice and it goes through successfully.\n Note: It is important to note that once the subscription moves into active state, the previous charges will not be re-attempted and only future billing cycles will be charged automatically.\n\n→ Completed\nThis can happen during the last billing cycle of the subscription. If the subscription state remains in halted state till the last billing cycle, it automatically moves to Completed state. Since this is a terminal state, no further action can be taken.\n\n→ Cancelled\nThis indicates that the subscription has been cancelled either by the customer or the merchant during the lifecycle of a subscription. Since this is a terminal state, no further action can be taken.\n\n→ Halted\nThis indicates the subscription has continued to remain in halted state for more than one billing cycle.\n  Action on Razorpay: Invoices will continue to generate for all billing cycles but no auto-charge will be attempted.\nAction on merchant/customer: The customer will either need to change the card or the customer/merchant will need to manually attempt a charge on an older unpaid invoice. If the older invoice is not successfully charged, the subscription will automatically move to active state.\n","url":"subscriptions/lifecycle"},{"title":"Managing Subscriptions","desc":"Manage Razorpay Subscriptions using invoices, defining trial period, upfront amount, add-ons, card change, manual charge on the same card and cancellation.","body":"\nYou can create a subscription with a trial period or an upfront amount or both! You can also include add-ons to your future invoices and handle retries using webhooks and mails. The following section explains each of these in detail to help you manage your subscriptions.\n\nInvoices\nFor all subscriptions, Razorpay automatically handles invoicing on behalf of the merchant making subscriptions a complete end-to-end solution for the merchant. Invoice includes details like plan, amount, date of charge including merchant details.\n\nThe section below describes the importance of an invoice and how it interacts with a subscription:\n\nAt the beginning of the each billing cycle, an invoice is generated for the defined plan and amount and a charge is attempted on the invoice. In this case, the invoice is in issued state on your Dashboard.\nIf the charge is successful, an email is sent to the customer informing of the same and the invoice is moved to paid state on your dashboard. At this time, a webhook is also fired informing the merchant of the same.\nIf one or more auto-charge attempts fail, an email is sent to the customer informing next steps to fix the issue.\nA merchant can manually charge on the invoice via the API or the Dashboard.\n  Until a successful charge on the invoice is made again, the invoice will be in issued state. To manually charge a customer from the Dashboard:\n \tLog in to your Dashboard.\n\tGo to Subscriptions.\n \tClick the Subcription Id in the pending state.\n \tOn the subscription details screen, click Attempt Retry. This will issue an invoice against the Subscription Id.\n \tOn the invoice details screen, click Attempt Charge to manually attempt a charge. An invoice detail screen appears as shown below:\n\n@image subs-manual-charge7.png\n\nInvoices are created for every charge made on the customer's card for the recurring payment (including the auth transaction). However, an invoice is not created when an upfront amount is absent and the start date is in the future. The table below explains different scenarios where an invoice is sent:\n\nupfront_amount\nstart_at\nInvoice sent\n\nAbsent\nImmediate\nYes\n\nAbsent\nFuture\nNo (Auth transaction)\n\nPresent\nImmediate\nYes\n\nPresent\nFuture\nYes\n\nTrial Period\nSubscriptions allow you to provide a trial period for your customers. You can create a fully-customised trial period that does not have to follow the typical 1-week or 1-month trial period. In order to create a trial period for your customers, all you need to provide is a future start-at parameter. The actual billing cycle automatically starts at the specific date - essentially creating a trial period. The following is an example of a trial period:\nAcme Corp. provides video streaming services and wants to offer a 1-month free trial.\nThe customer selects the plan on Jan 5th, 2017 and completes the auth transaction.\nDuring the auth transaction, Acme Corp. creates a subscription with start-at date of Feb 5th, 2017.\nNow, although the 2FA transaction was done on Jan 5th, 2017, the customer’s card will be charged only from Feb 5th, 2017.\nThe customer or merchant can decide to cancel the subscription at any time before that. The time between Jan 5th, 2017 and Feb 5th, 2017 could be used as a trial period.\n\nUpfront Amount\nThe upfront amount is charged at the time of auth transaction. The following is an example where an upfront amount is charged by a merchant who rents out furniture:\n\nMerchant provides furniture on rent.\nMerchant charges @data.Rs 1000 as security deposit. This needs to be collected before the delivery of furniture.\nWhile creating a subscription for the customer, merchant passes an upfront amount of @data.Rs 1000.\nAt the time of subscribing (during auth transaction), @data.Rs 1000 is collected from the customer.\n\nIn a scenario, where upfront amount is not provided by the merchant, Razorpay will collect @data.Rs 5 as part of the auth transaction to validate the credit card. The amount is called a token amount and would be refunded back to the customer with 3 to 5 business days.\nUpfront Amount is charged when the customer subscribes to a plan.\n\nThe table below explains the various scenarios of what amount is collected from the customer during auth transaction:\n\nupfront_amount\nstart_at\nauth transaction amount\n\nAbsent\nImmediate\nplan_amount\n\nAbsent\nFuture\n@data.Rs 5 (will be auto refunded)\n\nPresent\nImmediate\nupfrontamount + planamount\n\nPresent\nFuture\nupfront_amount\n\nTo charge an upfront amount, add ons key needs to be passed at the time of creating a subscription.\nRefer Subscription API for APIs around creating and fetching subscriptions.\n\nAdd-ons\n\nAdd-ons can be also be charged to your customer during the course of the subscription. Add-ons are typically charged for extra-services taken by a customer during the billing cycle.\n\nFor example, Acme Corp. is a merchant who provides DTH services. Customer requests for HD channels for the next month and it costs an additional @data.Rs 300 over the existing fixed recurring charges.\nBefore the next billing cycle, Acme Corp. can request to add @data.Rs 300 on top of the existing fixed recurring charges using add-ons.\n\n Note: Add-ons are charged for a single billing cycle only. They are not recurring in nature and will be automatically removed from the next billing cycle unless added again by the merchant.\n\nChange Card\nIn case an auto-charge on a card fails, we will send out an email notification informing your customer about the failed payment. This email will include further actions that your customer can take, which are:\nManually attempt the charge on the same card\nChange card on the subscription.\nThese emails are automated and take care of the re-try flow and no intervention is required from your end.\n\nNote: If a card change is initiated when the subscription status is pending, we will attempt to charge the latest invoice.\n\nManual Charge on the Same Card\n\nWhen a manual charge on the same card is done, @data.Rs 5 as auth transaction is carried out.\nOnce the manual charge on the card is successfully completed:\nCustomer receives an email\nYou receive a webhook.\n\nCancellation\nYou can cancel subscriptions yourself, either through the API or the Dashboard.\nCancellation takes effect immediately. Once a customer’s subscription is cancelled, no further invoices are generated on that subscription, nor any charges are attempted on the subscription. The subscription cannot be reactivated from this state.\nIf you want to refund money to the customer after cancelling a subscription, you can refund the corresponding amount on a previous payment on the subscription.\n\n Note: A merchant can opt to cancel a subscription at the end of the current subscription cycle. The subscription will then move to cancelled state at the end of the current period.\n\nA subscription can be cancelled at multiple stages such as:\n\nAuthenticated State\nActive State\nHalted State\n\nSome examples of cancelled subscription are listed below:\nIf a customer is on a trial period, the subscription can be cancelled before the trial period gets over. This ensures that the customer is not charged for the next billing cycle after the trial period ends.\nIf a subscription has been moved into the halted state, the merchant can either ask the customer to change their card or cancel the subscription, as per the business model.\nA customer can ask to cancel the subscription before the subscription cycle is complete.\n\n Note: The invoices for a subscription are created even when the subscription is in halted state. But these invoices will not be charged by us. They can be charged manually from the your merchant Dashboard.\n","url":"subscriptions/manage"},{"title":"Testing","desc":"Test Razorpay Subscriptions with test webhooks, test plan and subscription, test authentication transaction, and cancellation using our APIs/dashboard.","body":"\nThis section explains how you can create a test subscription, and test the various flows that may arise during actual use.\n\nSetting up a Webhook\n\nBefore we can get started with creation and management of our test subscriptions, we will need to configure a test webhook to receive notifications pertaining to the subscriptions. You can read about how a webhook can be configured here.\n\nCreating a Plan\n\nThe very first step of testing the subscriptions flow is to create a plan. Plans act as reusable templates, and if you only need a few of them, you can create them from your Razorpay dashboard, and use them in your code while creating subscriptions.\n\n@image subscriptions-dashboard-plan-create.png\n\nIf, however, your business requires the creation of plans on-the-fly, for example, a different plan for every customer, then you can also create plans via API. A sample payload for creation of a plan is given below.\n\n{\n  \"period\": \"monthly\",\n  \"interval\": 2,\n  \"item\": {\n    \"name\": \"Test plan\",\n    \"description\": \"₹500, charged every 2 months\",\n    \"amount\": 50000,\n    \"currency\": \"INR\"\n  }\n}\n\nFor our example, we will create a plan with a billing amount of ₹500 and a cycle of 2 months.\n\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -u \"rzptestyourTestApiKey:yourTestApiSecret\" \\\n  --data \"period=monthly\" \\\n  --data \"interval=2\" \\\n  --data \"item[name]=Test plan\" \\\n  --data \"item[amount]=50000\" \\\n  --data \"item[currency]=INR\" \\\n  https://api.razorpay.com/v1/plans\n{\n  \"id\": \"plan_8se9opU8rADx2t\",\n  \"entity\": \"plan\",\n  \"interval\": 1,\n  \"period\": \"monthly\",\n  \"item\": {\n    \"id\": \"item_8se9omR728cXv9\",\n    \"active\": true,\n    \"name\": \"Test plan\",\n    \"description\": \"₹500, charged every 2 months\",\n    \"amount\": 50000,\n    \"unit_amount\": 50000,\n    \"currency\": \"INR\",\n    \"type\": \"plan\",\n    \"unit\": null,\n    \"tax_inclusive\": false,\n    \"tax_id\": null,\n    \"taxgroupid\": null,\n    \"created_at\": 1508762880,\n    \"updated_at\": 1508762880\n  },\n  \"notes\": [],\n  \"created_at\": 1508762880\n}\n\nCreating a Subscription\n\nA subscription needs to be created for every customer who is using a plan. For our example, we will create a subscription for the plan created above, to be charged a total of 6 times, and due to be started immediately. We will refer to this as Subscription A.\n\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -u \"rzptestyourTestApiKey:yourTestApiSecret\" \\\n  --data \"planid=plan8se9opU8rADx2t\" \\\n  --data \"total_count=6\" \\\n  --data \"notes[name]=Subscription A\" \\\n  https://api.razorpay.com/v1/subscriptions\n{\n  \"id\": \"sub_8seKGNhVEOwnjj\",\n  \"entity\": \"subscription\",\n  \"planid\": \"plan8se9opU8rADx2t\",\n  \"customer_id\": null,\n  \"status\": \"created\",\n  \"current_start\": null,\n  \"current_end\": null,\n  \"ended_at\": null,\n  \"quantity\": 1,\n  \"notes\": {\n    \"name\": \"Subscription A\"\n  },\n  \"charge_at\": null,\n  \"start_at\": null,\n  \"end_at\": null,\n  \"auth_attempts\": 0,\n  \"total_count\": 6,\n  \"paid_count\": 0,\n  \"customer_notify\": true,\n  \"created_at\": 1508763473\n}\n\nWe will also create a second subscription, again to be charged a total of 6 times, but which is due to start on 1st January 2020. To indicate a future starting date, we send the desired timestamp in the start_at parameter in the request. We will refer to this as Subscription B.\n\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -u \"rzptestyourTestApiKey:yourTestApiSecret\" \\\n  --data \"planid=plan8se9opU8rADx2t\" \\\n  --data \"total_count=6\" \\\n  --data \"notes[name]=Subscription B\" \\\n  --data \"start_at=1577817000\" \\\n  https://api.razorpay.com/v1/subscriptions\n{\n  \"id\": \"sub_8seLkPNmUSPxut\",\n  \"entity\": \"subscription\",\n  \"planid\": \"plan8se9opU8rADx2t\",\n  \"customer_id\": null,\n  \"status\": \"created\",\n  \"current_start\": null,\n  \"current_end\": null,\n  \"ended_at\": null,\n  \"quantity\": 1,\n  \"notes\": {\n    \"name\": \"Subscription B\"\n  },\n  \"charge_at\": 1577817000,\n  \"start_at\": 1577817000,\n  \"end_at\": 1580841000,\n  \"auth_attempts\": 0,\n  \"total_count\": 6,\n  \"paid_count\": 0,\n  \"customer_notify\": true,\n  \"created_at\": 1508763558\n}\n\nBoth subscriptions are now in created state, and await a authentication transaction wherein the payer will authorize the use of his card by the subscription.\n\nMaking the Auth Payment\n\nTo authenticate a subscription, you will need to make a regular payment using Razorpay, but pass an extra subscription_id parameter in the options sent to checkout.js. To see this in action, use the following piece of code on a test webpage, and hit the Authenticate button. This will trigger a Razorpay payment that will in turn authenticate the subscription.\n\n    Authenticate\n\n      var options = {\n        \"key\": \"rzptest9bhKjJVNxvO3rB\",\n        \"subscriptionid\": \"sub8seKGNhVEOwnjj\",\n        \"name\": \"My Billing Label\",\n        \"description\": \"Auth txn for sub_8seKGNhVEOwnjj\",\n        \"handler\": function (response){\n          alert(response.razorpaypaymentid);\n        }\n      };\n      var rzp1 = new Razorpay(options);\n      document.getElementById('rzp-button').onclick = function(e){\n        rzp1.open();\n      }\n\nThese are the bare minimum options that need to be sent to initiate a payment, i.e. only key and subscription_id are mandatory. A complete list of options that can be passed can be found here.\n\nAmount\n\nNote that unlike a regular payment, amount does not need to be passed as an option here. This is because the amount to be charged is determined completely by the subscription that is being authenticated.\n\n For Subscription A, which is to start immediately upon completion of this payment, the charge amount will be ₹500, i.e. the amount we used while creating the plan.\n For subscription B, this payment acts only as an authentication step, as the subscription is not due to start until January 2020. So for subscription B, the charge amount is ₹5 - a token amount that will be immediately refunded.\n\nTest Card\nFor the test payment itself, you can use card number 5104015555555558 with any CVV, and any future expiry date. This is a test card that is valid for subscription payments. On usage of this card, you will be prompted to succeed or fail this payment on the mocked bank page.\n\nIf you choose to succeed the payment, the payment response will contain a few fields carrying information about the subscription that has been authenticated. You can read more about how this payment response can be authenticated here.\n\nEffects of the Auth Payment\nOnce the payment has been successfully, Subscription A is marked as active. At this stage you will also receive the webhook payloads for 2 events that Subscription A has gone through.\n Firstly, you will receive the subscription.activated webhook when Subscription A moves from created to activated state.\n Then, almost immediately afterwards, you will also receive the subscription.charged webhook when Subscription A moves from authenticated state to active state.\n\nNote that performing the same payment request on Subscription B will result it being marked as authenticated. It is not charged just yet, as it not due to be started at all for a few months. For this reason, no webhook events are triggered by performing an auth payment for Subscription B.\n\nSubsequent Charges\n\nAfter the first payment, i.e. the authentication of the subscription, all subsequent charges are triggered automatically by Razorpay. When these charges are triggered, the result or the impact upon the subscriptions entity is communicated via webhooks.\n\nIn test mode, it is possible to simulate these charges from the Razorpay dashboard, using the 'Charge This Now' button. Using this option, you can trigger all the same events and notifications that you would normally expected to take place on the next date that a subscription is due. Thus there is no need to wait till the start of January 2020 to see how Subscription B behaves in reponse to different events, as all of these events can be triggered before their given due date, in test mode.\n\n@image subscriptions-dashboard-test-charge.png\n\nExpected Webhooks\nYou can now integrate with our webhooks and ensure that the different webhook events are being consumed correctly.\n\nWith regards to our example, attempting a test charge on Subscription A will result in only one webhook event being triggered, i.e. simply subscription.charged.\n\nHowever, attempting a test charge from dashboard on Subscription B will result it moving from authenticated state to active state. This indicates that the start_at time of Subscription B has passed, and this will trigger an subscription.activated webhook. This is immediately followed by the charge itself, which will be trigger a subscription.charged webhook event.\n\nCharge Failures\n\nDuring the automatic charges initiated by Razorpay, it is possible that a charge attempt on the card saved for a subscription could fail. In this case too, failure event webhooks are triggered.\n\nTo simulate this in test mode, when used, the test charge option will prompt you to choose the result of a charge attempt. This is similar to the screen you had seen earlier, for the auth payment, when deciding on which result to choose for a test payment.\n\n@image subscriptions-dashboard-test-charge-result.png\n\n If you decide to charge a subscription as a success, a new payment is simply created (and captured), and a subscription.charged webhook is triggered.\n If you decide to charge a subscription as a failure, the subscription moves from active to pending state, and a subscription.pending webhook event is triggered. With each failure, the number of charge attempts made on a subscription increase, and the next charge time is updated by a single day, rather than the actual plan period, which in this case is two months.\n If you fail a charge 4 times in a row, you will have exhausted your remaining retries, and this results in a subscription being marked as halted. A subscription.halted webhook event is triggered as well.\n\nHalted Subscriptions\n\nOnce a subscription has reached halted state, Razorpay will no longer trigger automatic charge attempts on the saved card. However, invoices will continued to be issued in accordance with the orignal plan.\n\nIn test mode as well, the 'Charge This Now' button available on dashboard is replaced with an 'Issue Invoice' button for halted subscriptions. Using this option will issue a new invoice, but a charge will not be attempted on the saved card.\n\nManually Charging an Invoice\n\nThe invoices created by a subscription may remain in issued state if the charge attempts on the saved card result in failure. Once the max retries attempts are exhausted, the subscription is halted and moves on to the next plan period.\n\nHowever, the invoice that got left behind in that manner is still chargeable, after the customer has fixed the issue on his/her end (either by correcting the issue with his/her card, or simply changing the card associated with a subscription). This is via the 'Attempt Charge' option available for each invoice on dashboard. Using this option triggers a new charge attempt on that issued invoice, and not increase the number of retries remaining for a subscription.\n\n@image subscriptions-dashboard-invoice-manual-charge.png\n\n  A manual charge of an issued invoice is distinct from a test charge of a subscription.\n  A manual charge on an invoice is possible even in live mode, anytime an issue is observed to be in issued state. A manual charge attempt does not count towards he remaining retries that a subscription.\n  A charge of a subscription has be triggered by the merchant only in test mode, and the result of this charge attempt is up to the merchant. If failed, these attempts count towards the remaining retries that a subscription has before it moves to halted state.\n\nCompletion and Cancellation\n\nA subscription can be moved to any of the terminal states in the following ways.\n Charging a subscription repeatedly in test mode, until all the invoices for a subscription have been issued.\n Cancelling a subscription via dashboard or API.\n\n@image subscriptions-dashboard-cancel.png\n","url":"subscriptions/testing"},{"title":"Using Webhooks","body":"\nWebhooks are used to notify your site about events that occur on your account. Although webhooks can be used for many purposes, they are especially important when using subscriptions, as most activity occurs asynchronously and behind the scenes.\n\nAny activity performed with regards to a subscription can be notified to your system via webhooks.\n\nTo use webhooks with your subscriptions, follow the general webhooks guide to create your webhook endpoint.\n\nAvailable Webhooks\n\nSome of the webhooks that you can enable with subscriptions are listed below:\n\nsubscription.activated\n: Sends an event when the subscription moves to activated state. This event is fired even when the subscription moves from pending or halted to active state. Note that the last charge would not be attempted if a subscription has been moved to active from pending or halted. Only the subsequent billing cycles would be charged.\n\nsubscription.charged\n: This event is fired every time there is a successful charge on the subscription.\n\nsubscription.pending\n: Sends an event when the subscription has moved into pending state. This happens when the charge has failed. We would retry charging the card on a periodic basis in the meantime.\n\nsubscription.halted\n: Sends an event when all retries have been exhausted and the subscription has now moved to halted state. The customer would have to manually retry the charge or change their card, for the subscription to move into active state again.\n\nsubscription.cancelled\n: This event is fired when a subscription is cancelled and is moved to the cancelled state.\n\nsubscription.completed\n: Once a subscription completes all the billing cycles, this event gets fired. This is basically called when the subscription moves to completed state.\n\nNote: The payload for all these events would contain the subscription entity. They would also contain a payment entity if a payment attempt was made before the event was triggered. Refer the payloads examples given in the Sample Payload page.\n\nExamples\n\nSome examples on where you can use webhooks are given below:\n\nDelivering the service after receiving subscription.charged.\nHalting the service when you receive subscription.halted or delaying the service when you receive subscription.pending\nCommunicating to the customer for a change of card or reattempting a charge when you receive subscription.pending or subscription.halted events.\nResume the service if delayed or halted, on receiving subscription.activated. The last charge would have to be reattempted manually from the dashboard or via the API, after the subscription moves into active state from halted or pending.\n","url":"subscriptions/webhooks"},{"title":"Team Support","body":"\nIntroduction\n\nYou can invite members in your organization and assign various roles to team using the option Team provided in the Razorpay Dashboard.\n\nTo access the Team feature:\n\nOn the Razorpay Dashboard, click My Account.\nClick Manage Team  tab.\n\nThe Manage Team screen appears as shown below.

According to PCI regulations, payment processing is not allowed on TLS 1.0. To process a payment, TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 should be configured on the device. In case of Android devices, TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 both are rolled out together. This condition will be effective from May 31st and Payments via Razorpay will not work on devices that does not have TLS 1.2 configured.\n\nWhich devices have TLS 1.2 enabled?\nAs per official Android documentation, TLS 1.2 is supported in API level 16+ and enabled by default in API level 20+. Please note that for API levels 16, 17, 18 and 19, it’s not guaranteed that TLS 1.2 will be enabled. So if TLS 1.2 is not enabled in any of these devices then the SDK will give an error for the same and users will not be able to complete payments.\n\nHow would the existing apps be affected?\nIf the device does not have TLS 1.2, the payment will fail with an error message given in onPaymentError callback. The devices which have TLS 1.2 would not be affected.\n\nUpcoming SDK changes:\nWe will update minSdkVersion to 19 in our SDK and will support Android devices with API level 19 and above.\n\nIf your app wants to support any device which has lower API version, then you may override the minSdkVersion of our SDK. In such a case, if devices do not have TLS 1.2, payment will still fail. You can check by calling Checkout.isDeviceSupported() method, if the SDK is triggered for a device without TLS 1.2, the SDK will give the error (\"The device does not have TLSv1.2\") in onPaymentError callback. Please refer to sample code given below to override minSdkVersion of the SDK.\n\nFAQs\n\nQ: Being a Merchant, do I need to take any action?\\\nA: Unless you are using Java/.NET on your server backend or your customers are using any of the above mentioned device platforms, there is no action required from your end.\n\nQ: How do I know if a customer is affected?\\\nA: The Checkout popup won't open for the customer's browser/app. Please ask them to upgrade their browser or device.\n\nQ: Is Android affected as well?\\\nA: Yes, we can no longer support our Android SDK on Android versions below 4.4 (4.4 is supported). This is less than 0.5% of payments that we see on the platform.\n\nQ: Is there a new Android SDK release?\\\nA: Yes. Our new release sets the minimum version of our SDK to Android 4.4\n\nIf you have any further queries, please mail us at .\n","url":"tls"},{"title":"API Reference","index":false,"body":"\nRefer to our Getting Started documentation to understand the basic concepts of our API usage.\n\nNote: Before you create a wallet you need to create a customer.\n\nTransfer Payment\n\n/payments/:id/transfers\n\nIf the customer wallet entity does not exist, this API will create a wallet for a customer_id.

To create a Customer via the\nAPI or the Dashboard, refer Customers\npage. Creating a customer will also generate a unique customer_id which used for managing the customer's wallet via APIs.\n\nThe different types of wallet operations are explained below:\n\nLoad a Wallet\n\nWhen a customer adds funds/money into the wallet, it is called loading a wallet. A wallet is\ncreated only when a customer adds funds/money into the wallet for the first time.\n\nThe following are the steps for loading a wallet. In these steps, we are using @data.Rs 500 as the amount to be loaded:\n\nCustomer proceeds to Checkout from the normal payment flow for an amount @data.Rs 500 via the selected payment mode (Net Banking/Debit card/Credit card/UPI).\nYou authenticate the customer in your backend and make a capture payment request for the payment made and the amount gets credited to your account.\nYou make a transfer payment request of @data.Rs 500 to the customer’s wallet.\n\tCustomer’s wallet gets credited with @data.Rs 500 and your account gets debited with the same amount.\nWe send a ‘success information’ response which you may show to your customer.\n\nThe following image illustrates the flow of funds while loading a wallet:\n\n@image loading_wallet(merchant)3.png\n\nReloading the wallet at the time of checkout will have the same flow. This usually happens when customers find out that they have insufficient balance in their wallets at the time of making a payment.\n\nRefer the APIs used in this operation with examples in the\nAPI reference section\n\nAccept Payments from Wallet\n\nThe following are the steps for accepting payment from a wallet. In these steps, we are using @data.Rs 500 as the amount to be payed by the customer:\n\nCustomer initiates a payment of @data.Rs 500 for an order from the wallet.\n1. You authenticate the customer in your backend and make a create payment request with the customer_id.\nYou make a capture payment request for the payment of @data.Rs 500.\n\t@data.Rs 500 gets debited from the customer’s wallet and your balance gets credited with the same amount.\n\nThe following image illustrates the flow of funds when a payment is made from the wallet:\n\n@image paytomerchant(merchant)3.png\n\nRefer the APIs used in this operation with examples in the\nAPI reference section\n\nRefund to Wallet\n\nThe following are the steps for refunding a payment made from wallet to the wallet. In these steps, we are using @data.Rs 500 as the amount to be refunded:\n\nYou make a refund to wallet request for a payment of @data.Rs 500 with the payment_id.\nCustomer’s wallet gets credited with @data.Rs 500 and your balance gets debited with the same amount.\n\nNote: Refunds are always made against an payment. While making a refund, we identify the customer (payee) with the payment_id generated at the time of payment.\n\nThe following image illustrates the flow of refund made to the wallet:\n\n@image refundtowallet(merchant)3.png\n\nRefer the API used in this operation with examples in the\nAPI reference section\n\nSend Cashback to Wallet\n\nThe following are the steps for sending cashback to a wallet.

This allows Razorpay to tie the bank account with the particular customer Id and thereby process a fund transfer initiated towards that account.\n\nRefer the API reference section to make a payout.\n","url":"wallet/wallet-operations"},{"title":"Webhooks","desc":"Use webhooks to get notified when Razorpay payment are authorized, captured, failed, order paid, invoice paid/expired, settlement processed and dispute created.","body":"Introduction\n\nWebhooks allow you to build or set up integrations which subscribe to\ncertain events on Razorpay API. When one of those events is triggered,\nwe send an HTTP POST payload in JSON to the webhook's configured URL.\n\nYou can set up a webhook from your dashboard and configure separate URLs\nfor live mode and test mode.\nA test mode webhook will only receive events for your test transactions.\nIn URLs, only port numbers 80 and 443 are currently allowed.\n\nWhen setting up the webhook, you will be asked to specify a secret. Using\nthis secret, you can validate that the webhook is from Razorpay. Entering the\nsecret is optional but recommended. The secret should never be exposed anywhere\npublicly.\n\nIdempotency\nYour server should be configured to handle or receive the same event\ndetails multiple times. In case you are receiving the same webhook event again,\nyou should check for the same webhook event data and ignore it.\n\nDeactivation\n\nAll webhook responses must return a status code in the range 2XX within a window\nof 5 seconds. If we receive response codes other than this or if the request\ntimes out, it is considered a failure. On failure, a webhook is retried once every hour for 24 hours. If we keep receiving failure responses consecutively for 24 hours, we disable the webhook. You will then need to manually\nre-enable the webhook from the Dashboard after fixing the errors at your end.\n\nNote: For every failure, we send out an email notification along with the reason\nand the error code received by us.\n\nAvailable Events\nFollowing table describes the events for which webhooks are currently\navailable:\n\nPayments\npayment.authorized\n: Triggered whenever a payment is authorized.\n\npayment.captured\n: Triggered whenever a payment is successfully captured.\n\npayment.failed\n: Triggered whenever a payment fails.\n\nOrders\n\norder.paid\n: Triggered when an order is successfully paid.\n\nInvoices\n\ninvoice.paid\n: Triggered when an invoice is successfully paid.\n\ninvoice.expired\n: Triggered when an invoice gets expired.\n\nSettlements\n\nsettlement.processed\n: Triggered when a transfer made to a linked account is settled with the parent merchant.

Two of which are listed\nbelow:\n\nCapturing Delayed Authorized Payments\nCapturing payments for which you did not receive a response on client side\nis perhaps the most important use case for payment.authorized event.\nSometimes, the communication between the bank and Razorpay or between you and\nRazorpay may not take place. This could be due to slow network connection, or\nclosing the window when payment is being processed.\nThis could lead to a payment being marked as Failed on Razorpay Dashboard\nbut changed to Authorized at a later time. You can use webhooks to get\nnotified about payments that get authorized and analyse this data to decide\nwhether or not to capture the payment.\n\nNotifications on Failed Payments\nWhen a payment attempted by your customer fails, we receive the failed payment status\nfrom the bank. This payment gets recorded in our system as Failed.\nIf you have enabled the webhook for the event payment.failed, you will receive a\nnotification from us about the failed payment.

If the customer's currency is not INR, convert it to INR.\n    Pass amount in Paise. For example, 50.45 INR has to be passed as 5045 in the amount parameter.\n    The receipt parameter should be the order ID at your end. If you do not have an invoice/order ID, you can generate one. This is something that you will be quoting to your customers.\nStore the order ID at your end. The order ID starts with order and is 20 characters long (including the order prefix). Store it in the session or the database.\nOpen Checkout, with all the required parameters. Also, ensure that you pass the order_id parameter as well. Using automatic checkout is recommended, unless you are well versed with JavaScript.\n4 Set the form action parameter in automatic checkout to your post-processing page.\nStore the following 3 parameters from post submission:\n  razorpaypaymentid\n  razorpay_signature\n  razorpayorderid\n:lock: Verify the signature using the 3 parameters.\n:lock: If the signature verification passes, lookup your invoice/order ID against the razorpayorderid, and mark that as successful.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow do I signup for a test account?\n\nYou can signup for a Razorpay account at https://dashboard.razorpay.com. You don't need to submit any documents, and the test mode is enabled for your account as soon as you confirm your email address.\n\nHow do I find SDKs for various languages?\n\nWe provide ready-to-use SDK packages for various languages. You can find a complete list at razorpay.com/integrations/. If the language you prefer is not in the list, you can continue making the requests using CURL or HTTP package of that particular language.\n\nHow to create a Razorpay API instance?\n\nPlease see the README file of that particular SDK.\n\nHow do I find my Razorpay credentials?\n\nThe email/password is only used to login to the Dashboard. To authenticate against the API, you will need to generate a KeyID, and KeySecret. You can generate the same by logging in to the dashboard, then visiting the Settings->API Keys section.\n\nHow do I find the base URL for Razorpay API?\n\nThe current Razorpay API is versioned at v1, so all requests should be made to https://api.razorpay.com/v1/\n\nHow do I find Sample Code for my language?\n\nWe have sample applications for many languages, and you can find the same at razorpay.com/integrations/.\n\nHow do I decide between automatic or manual checkout?\n\nAutomatic checkout is usually very easy to integrate into your own product. However, when you have multiple products, or a complex way to pre-calculate amount for a payment (in javascript), you can switch to the manual checkout method for greater control.\n\nRule of thumb: Use Automatic Checkout if you are confused. Manual Checkout is helpful if you are integrating with a Javascript framework, or want more control in the payment process. See our Checkout Docs for more details.\n\nCommon Gotchas\n\nFollowing are some of the common issues that you must watch out for while integrating:\n\nNot storing the Razorpay Order ID at your end.\nPassing the amount from the frontend to the Razorpay order creation call.\nPassing USD or any other non-INR currency while creating the order.\nPassing razorpayorderid from the frontend while verifying the signature.\n\nAlternatively, you can use this value to check the integrity of the signature, while looking up the corresponding order at your end with this Razorpay Order ID and marking only that as successful.\n\nChecklist\n\nAn integration related to-do list is given below. Ensure that you have taken into account all of the following while integrating:\n\nClone Razorpay Sample application in your language and test the flow with it.\nCorrectly generate the Razorpay Order ID.\nCorrectly show checkout to the customer.\nVerify the signature post checkout form submission.\nDisplay a confirmation message to the customer.\nMark the Platform Order as successful after looking up razorpayorderid.\nTest for failure cases.\n\nSpecial Use Cases\n\nFollowing are some specific cases whose integration is handled on case-to-case basis:\n\nDonations\n\nIf the platform is used for Donations, you cannot rely on the amount to be generated on the backend. While you will be ignoring this check, you should still be storing the Razorpay Order ID, and re-verifying it after payment completion.\n\nAlso, note that we won't be able to activate all non-profits, and would be considering such merchants on a case-to-case basis.\n\nWebviews\n\nIf your website is likely to be accessed mostly in the facebook browser, or via other mobile applications in a webview, it might face certain issues. See our docs for more details on how to handle this.\n\nNetwork Connectivity Issues\n\nIf the customer has an issue with the network connectivity, your website will not be informed of the customer completing the payment. In such cases, you can use Webhooks to get notified of all authorized payments, and mark them as successful at your end.\n\nHelp and Support\n\nYou can get in touch with us at https://razorpay.com/support for any queries.\nIf you have a registered merchant account, you can also use the Support chat feature on the Razorpay Dashboard.\n\n[integrations]: https://razorpay.com/integrations/ \"Razorpay Integrations List\"\n[checkout-docs]: https://docs.razorpay.com/docs/checkout-form\n[callback]: https://docs.razorpay.com/v1/page/callback-url \"Callback URL Documentation\"\n[webhooks]: https://razorpay.com/docs/webhooks/ \"Webhooks Docs\"\n","url":"integrations/guides/platform"},{"title":"API Authentication","body":"\nWe use Basic Auth for authenticating Partner requests.

Along with providing a platform to their clients, they are also involved in managing their transactions.\n\nThis means Aggregator Partners can collect payments, create refunds as well as view settlements on behalf of their clients, via API as well as Dashboard access.\n\nImagine a company, Acme Corp. wants to manage payments on its application, for its client Gekko & Co. Since Acme cannot natively to do so, it signs up with Razorpay as a Partner, and creates a sub-merchant account for Gekko.\nOnce the sub-merchant account is activated, Acme Corp can use its account credentials to create and manage transactions on behalf of Gekko.

Unlike Aggregators, Reseller Partners are typically not involved in managing transactions on behalf of their clients.\n\nThe Reseller Partner model focuses mainly on the commissions earned by the merchant for their referrals.\n\nFor example, a blogging platform company, Acme, registers as a Reseller with Razorpay and refers a client.
